KDCube is a **self‑hosted agent enforcement runtime** that blocks unsafe actions
before execution — with hard budget caps, tenant isolation, and subprocess
sandboxing at the infrastructure layer.
Ship AI copilots **to your customers, not just to yourself**, with the full
stack: agent runtime, streaming protocol, tool execution, memory, economics,
and operations.

*For engineering teams shipping AI agents to production.*

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kdcube/kdcube-ai-app && cd kdcube-ai-app

# copy sample env files and add your API keys
cd app/ai-app/deployment/docker/all_in_one_kdcube
cp sample_env/.env.postgres.setup .env.postgres.setup
cp sample_env/.env.ingress       .env.ingress
cp sample_env/.env.proc          .env.proc
cp sample_env/.env.metrics       .env.metrics
cp sample_env/.env.frontend      .env.frontend

# prepare data directories
mkdir -p ./data/{postgres,redis,clamav-db}
chmod -R 0777 data logs

# start the full stack (Postgres, Redis, ClamAV, chat services, web UI, proxy)
docker compose up -d --build
```

Or install the CLI wizard: `pipx install kdcube-apps-cli && kdcube-apps-cli`

**Highlights**
- **Full stack**: from streaming protocols to tool execution, memory, economics, and ops.
- **Agent‑first**: a ready‑made, versatile ReAct‑style agent that can be extended or replaced.
- **No tool‑calling lock‑in**: the agent runs on plain prompt/completion while fully emulating tool‑calling (and more).
- **Built for real apps**: multi‑tenant isolation, backpressure, rate limits, and observability.
- **Channeled streaming + live widgets**: animate UX with streaming channels and custom widgets.
- **Provenance by default**: source pools and citations to prove how answers were built.
- **Feedback‑aware**: user feedback is captured and can be fed back into workflows.

## Out of the Box

**Runtime & streaming**
- Streaming chat over **SSE / REST / Socket.IO** with step/delta/status events
- Fine‑grained streaming channels (answer, reasoning, artifacts, subsystem payloads)
- Session‑aware relay + fan‑out for multiple tabs/clients

**Agent capabilities**
- Versatile **ReAct‑style solver** (planning, tool‑first/code‑first flows)
- Skills + tools (local + MCP) with easy custom wiring
- Built‑in **web search** and citations pipeline

**Execution & artifacts**  
- **Isolated code execution** (Docker + Fargate)  
- Attachments + generated artifacts with storage + indexing  
- **Antivirus scanning** for uploads  
- Dynamic widgets (interactive timeline banners + live content: web search/fetch, exec panels, bundle‑driven panels)  

**Memory & context**  
- Turn/context memories, conversation memories, retrieval  
- **Source pools** per conversation (Perplexity‑style traceability)  
- Structured sources + citations (with in‑stream rendering)

**Operations & safety**  
- Multi‑tenant / multi‑project isolation  
- Gateway: auth, rate limits, backpressure, circuit breakers  
- **Economics & accounting** (usage, budgets, rate limits)  
- Monitoring + metrics service for autoscaling
- **Feedback system** (user feedback signals integrated into workflow)
- **Role‑based event filtering** (stream only what each role is allowed to see)
- **Dynamic bundle UIs** (React interfaces exposed by bundles, authorization‑guarded)

- **Storage**: Postgres + Redis + object store integration

## ReAct v2 — Timeline‑First Agent (KDCube Signature)

KDCube’s ReAct v2 agent is **timeline‑first**: every turn event is captured as structured blocks onto turn timeline
that become the **source of truth** for memory, artifacts, and future reasoning.  
Turn timeline evolves into a running conversation timeline.
This is not a thin wrapper around tool calls — it’s a full **stateful operating layer**.

**Highlights**
- **Timeline as ground truth**: user prompts, tool calls/results, artifacts, and decisions are stored as blocks.
- **Rendering**: timeline can be rendered differently to an agent based on filters / cache TTL / compaction state.
- **Compaction + cache checkpoints**: stable prefixes + safe tail edits at scale.
- **Source pools + citations**: Perplexity‑style traceability with stable source IDs.
- **Artifact paths & rehydration**: `fi:/ar:/so:/tc:` logical paths + rehosting on demand.
- **Tool‑aware UX**: widgets stream into timeline banners (web search, fetch, exec, panels).
- **Memory tools**: `react.read`, `react.hide`, `react.memsearch`, `react.patch` to recover or reshape context.
- **Turn snapshots & versioning**: each turn persists a timeline snapshot + data snapshot; edits produce a new version in the *current turn namespace*, making state **recoverable** and **replayable**.

The timeline is **temporal** and **single‑source‑of‑truth**:
- It powers **UI reconstruction** (user messages, attachments, artifacts created, sources used, canvas streams, thinking blocks).
- It powers **agent context rendering** (the model sees the same ordered timeline, filtered by policy).
- The agent can **reshape the tail** (e.g., hide large blocks) to keep context clean and efficient.
- **Cache‑aware visibility**: cache TTL is tracked so older context can be *briefly surfaced* (not compacted away) with re‑read paths for recovery.
- **Announce system**: ephemeral signals to the agent (recent pruning, active plans, important memories, current sources pool).

## Status & Roadmap (near‑term)

- **Bundles from Git** (dynamic bundle loading, no baked images)
- **ECS deployment** with proper autoscaling (in progress)
- **Copilot‑style workspace UX** (new timeline/announce events/workspace organization)

Planned deployment options (next steps):
- **AWS ECS/Fargate** (first‑class)
- **Kubernetes** (EKS / GKE / AKS)
Docker Compose is already supported for local and small‑scale (with EC2) setups.
