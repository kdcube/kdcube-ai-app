# KDCube — Platform and SDK for AI applications you control

KDCube is a self-hosted platform, SDK, runtime, and control plane for AI
applications. It packages backend logic, APIs, widgets, full frontend
surfaces, MCP, scheduled jobs, configuration, state, streaming, and
agent/runtime behavior into deployable application units that run inside
isolated environments.

Inside KDCube, those deployable application units are called `bundles`.
A bundle is a folder with code and resources that KDCube can load directly
from your local filesystem, or from Git by repository ref plus the path to the
bundle folder inside that repo. In practice, almost anything that can run
inside the KDCube / FastAPI runtime can be packaged as a bundle. It is not a
narrow plugin or a prompt wrapper. It is the platform term for one application
that can contain backend, frontend, jobs, tools, configuration, storage, and
runtime behavior together.

One `tenant/project` is one isolated KDCube environment. One environment can
host many applications. In KDCube terms, each of those applications is one
bundle.

KDCube runs on a single-node local machine with Docker Compose, and the same
environment model carries to EC2-style and ECS-based deployments. You do not
need a cloud control plane to start.

## What KDCube Gives You

- a platform + SDK for building new AI apps or wrapping existing systems
- a live control plane for enabling, disabling, gating, and hot-reapplying
  bundles and their APIs, widgets, MCP surfaces, and jobs
- an execution model with ReAct Agent, Claude Code, custom Python flows,
  `@venv(...)`, and isolated exec
- a real trust boundary: trusted tool calls run through bundle tools; untrusted
  generated code runs in isolated exec
- economics and accounting: economic tiers, project budgets, service rate
  limits, price-table accounting, and billing hooks
- attachments, artifacts, and bundle storage on local FS, blob storage, or
  Git-backed stores
- streaming and transport surfaces over REST, SSE, Socket.IO, and MCP

## Mental Model

- `tenant/project` = one isolated KDCube environment
- one environment can host many applications
- one application unit inside that environment is called a `bundle`
- bundle surfaces can be controlled independently and updated live

Use separate environments for `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, or for parallel
isolated deployments that must not share runtime state, budgets, or
configuration.

## What You Can Build

- AI copilots and assistants with custom workflows and domain logic
- internal operational tools with authenticated APIs, admin widgets, and
  scheduled jobs
- public AI-backed APIs, webhooks, and MCP surfaces
- full iframe-based applications with their own frontend
- scheduled or background AI pipelines
- wrappers around existing services or codebases that need a governed runtime
- multi-surface products where chat, API, widget, UI, and cron logic belong to
  the same application

## Application Shape In KDCube

The main unit in KDCube is an application that the platform internally calls a
bundle. Concretely, a bundle is a folder with code, descriptors, and optional
UI/resources that KDCube resolves either from the local filesystem or from a
Git repo at a specific ref and bundle path. Almost anything that can run in the
KDCube / FastAPI runtime can be packaged this way. A bundle can expose several
surfaces at once. That is the normal model, not an edge case.

Typical bundle structure:

```text
my.bundle@1-0/
  entrypoint.py
  orchestrator/
    workflow.py
  tools_descriptor.py
  skills_descriptor.py
  tools/
  skills/
  ui/
  ui-src/
  resources/
  tests/
  requirements.txt
  backend_bridge/
```

Python remains the KDCube-native shell. If you need selected backend logic in
Node or TypeScript, keep the KDCube surface in Python and place the external
backend behind a narrow bridge.

## Build With Agents Too

KDCube now documents itself in a way that works for both engineers and coding
agents.

The docs include:

- a compact Tier 1 bundle-authoring pack
- a reference bundle that demonstrates the platform shape
- explicit configuration and runtime ownership rules
- local run, reload, and test guidance

This means an agent can help with real bundle work as:

- creator
- integrator
- configurator
- deployer
- local QA
- integration QA
- document reader

## Agent and Runtime Model

KDCube is not limited to one agent shape.

Inside one bundle you can combine these runtime pieces together:

- ReAct Agent for timeline-first orchestration, shared/user-facing assistants,
  full virtualization, isolated workspace work, ANNOUNCE, and tool-driven execution
- Claude Code for owner/admin coding flows and complex coding pipelines where a
  persistent coding agent is useful
- custom Python agents for domain-specific flows
- isolated exec for generated code and controlled execution
- `@venv(...)` for dependency-heavy Python leaf helpers

This is not an exclusive `either/or` choice.

One bundle can, for example:

- receive a chat request through the platform chat channel
- route that request into the bundle execution path
- use ReAct Agent for orchestration, workspace work, tools, and shared chat behavior
- call Claude Code for selected owner/admin coding tasks inside the same app
- delegate selected untrusted code to isolated exec
- use `@venv(...)` helpers for dependency-heavy Python leaf jobs
- keep other steps in ordinary Python bundle code

Current product entry paths for chat are:

- SSE-backed chat ingress
- Socket.IO-backed chat ingress

Those channels currently carry the chat request and attachments into the bundle
execution path. In normal chat flow, non-`steer` and non-`followup` messages
are routed into the bundle's main execution path. Conceptually, the channel is
still a platform message transport, not a restriction to one internal agent
mode.

Security and isolation rule:

- ReAct Agent is the strongly isolated runtime for shared and user-facing agent work
- Claude Code is useful for some complex coding flows, especially owner/admin scenarios
- do not treat Claude Code and ReAct Agent as equivalent from a trust-boundary perspective

Important: ReAct Agent is not based on provider-native tool-calling protocol.
The loop is controlled by the platform runtime, not by a model-specific
tool-call format. That lets you use non-tool-calling models as the reasoning
brain when they can follow the ReAct contract.
