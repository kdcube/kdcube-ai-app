# KDCube — Build, Run, and Ship End-to-End AI Products

KDCube is a self-hosted platform and SDK for packaging AI applications —
APIs, agents, UI, scheduled jobs, configuration, and state — into deployable
bundles and running them in isolated environments.

One KDCube environment can host many bundles. A bundle is not just a prompt, a
chatbot skin, or an agent wrapper. It is one application unit that can combine:

- Python backend logic
- authenticated and public APIs
- widgets and a full custom UI
- React v2, Claude Code, and/or custom agents
- tools, skills, MCP, storage, settings, props, and secrets
- scheduled jobs with `@cron(...)`
- dependency-isolated helpers with `@venv(...)`
- optional Node or TypeScript backend logic behind a Python bridge

KDCube gives you the runtime, streaming, provenance, isolation, configuration
model, and deployment model needed to ship real AI systems rather than only
local agent demos.

## Positioning

Use KDCube when you need more than a model call and a thin web shell.

KDCube is for teams that need to:

- turn a new product idea into a real AI application
- wrap an existing backend, frontend, webhook, or pipeline into a bundle
- run more than one application surface inside one environment
- keep deployment config, bundle config, and user state separated cleanly
- move from local iteration to hosted deployment without changing the app model

Important mental model:

- `tenant/project` = one isolated KDCube environment
- one environment can host many bundles
- one bundle = one end-to-end application unit inside that environment

This lets you use KDCube for lifecycle stages such as `dev`, `staging`, and
`prod`, and for parallel isolated environments that must not share runtime
state.

## What You Can Build

- AI copilots and assistants with custom workflows and domain logic
- internal operational tools with authenticated APIs, admin widgets, and cron
- public AI-backed APIs or webhooks
- full iframe-based applications with their own frontend
- scheduled or background AI pipelines
- wrappers around existing services or codebases that need a KDCube runtime
- multi-surface products where chat, API, widget, UI, and cron logic belong to
  the same application

## Core Capabilities

### Application surfaces

- chat behavior through `@on_message`
- authenticated APIs through `@api(route="operations")`
- public or externally authenticated APIs through `@api(route="public")`
- widgets through `@ui_widget(...)`
- a full custom main UI through `@ui_main`
- scheduled logic through `@cron(...)`
- MCP integration through `@mcp(...)`

### Runtime and execution

- streaming UX over SSE / REST / Socket.IO
- React v2, Claude Code, custom Python agents, and isolated exec
- dependency-isolated Python helpers with `@venv(...)`
- optional Docker and Fargate execution paths

### State, configuration, and provenance

- platform/global settings and secrets
- deployment-scoped bundle props and bundle secrets
- user-scoped bundle state owned by the bundle
- timelines, source pools, citations, artifacts, and rehydration

### Operations and deployment

- isolated environments per `tenant/project`
- gateway controls, backpressure, rate limits, and budgets
- metrics, economics, and operational visibility
- local Docker Compose, EC2-style, and ECS-based deployments

## Bundle Shape

The main unit in KDCube is a bundle.

A bundle can expose several surfaces at once. That is the normal model, not an
edge case.

Typical bundle structure:

```text
my.bundle@1-0/
  entrypoint.py
  orchestrator/
    workflow.py
  tools_descriptor.py
  skills_descriptor.py
  tools/
  skills/
  ui/
  ui-src/
  resources/
  tests/
  requirements.txt
  backend_bridge/
```

Python remains the KDCube-native shell. If you need selected backend logic in
Node or TypeScript, keep the KDCube surface in Python and place the external
backend behind a narrow bridge.

## Build With Agents Too

KDCube now documents itself in a way that works for both engineers and coding
agents.

The docs include:

- a compact Tier 1 bundle-authoring pack
- a reference bundle that demonstrates the platform shape
- explicit configuration and runtime ownership rules
- local run, reload, and test guidance

This means an agent can help with real bundle work as:

- creator
- integrator
- configurator
- deployer
- local QA
- integration QA
- document reader

## Quick Start

Install the bootstrap CLI and launch the setup wizard:

```bash
pipx install kdcube-cli
kdcube
```

Alternative:

```bash
pip install kdcube-cli
kdcube
```

`kdcube-setup` remains available as a compatibility alias, but `kdcube` is the
canonical command.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Docker

## Agent and Runtime Model

KDCube is not limited to one agent shape.

Inside one bundle you can use:

- React v2 for timeline-first orchestration, planning, ANNOUNCE, and tool-driven work
- Claude Code for workspace-scoped coding tasks with persistent session identity
- custom Python agents for domain-specific flows
- isolated exec for generated code and controlled execution
- `@venv(...)` for dependency-heavy Python leaf helpers

Important: React v2 is not based on provider-native tool-calling protocol. The
loop is controlled by the platform runtime, not by a model-specific tool-call
format. That lets you use non-tool-calling models as the reasoning brain when
they can follow the ReAct contract.

If you want to build AI applications fast but still control runtime, tools,
costs, deployment, provenance, and operations, KDCube is aimed at that use
case.
