# Playwright Integration

This document describes how KDCube uses Playwright for browser-backed tools and rendering.

The current browser integration has two layers:

- A process-wide shared Chromium service.
- Per-turn BrowserContexts managed by `browser_tools`.

## Shared Browser Service

The shared browser service lives in:

```text
kdcube_ai_app/infra/rendering/shared_browser.py
```

Callers use:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.rendering.shared_browser import get_shared_browser

shared_browser = await get_shared_browser()
browser = await shared_browser.get_browser()
```

`get_shared_browser()` lazily starts one Playwright driver and one Chromium browser process for the current
Python process. This is already used by rendering utilities such as PDF/PNG generation.

The shared browser service is responsible for:

- Starting Playwright.
- Launching Chromium.
- Reusing the browser process across renderers/tools.
- Closing browser/Playwright on process shutdown when requested.

It is not responsible for per-user or per-turn isolation. That isolation happens at the BrowserContext layer.

## BrowserContext Scope

Playwright `Browser` is process-wide. Playwright `BrowserContext` is the isolation boundary.

`browser_tools` creates one BrowserContext per derived browser session:

```text
tenant + project + user_id + conversation_id + turn_id + request_id + bundle_id
```

The exact key is hashed before storage:

```text
browser:<sha256-prefix>
```

The human-readable `session_label` is returned for diagnostics, but the map key is a hash.

Why per-turn context:

- Same turn can reuse page state across `open_page`, `click`, `fill`, and `status`.
- Same turn can have multiple tabs.
- Different users/turns do not share cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, or open pages.
- A canceled turn can be garbage-collected without affecting other active turns.

## Multiple Tabs

Each session stores a `pages` map:

```text
tab_id -> Playwright Page
```

Examples:

- `main`
- `app`
- `reference`
- `mobile`

Tabs in the same session share the same BrowserContext and therefore the same browser storage. This is intentional
for one turn. Use separate sessions only when state must be isolated.

## Tool Runtime Placement

Browser tools must run in-process:

```python
"browser_tools.open_page": "none"
```

Do not route `browser_tools.*` through isolated exec or local subprocess mode. A subprocess gets its own module
memory, so the supervisor BrowserContext and named tabs would not persist between ReAct tool calls.

Generated Python code inside `exec_tools.execute_code_python` should not directly control the supervisor-side
`browser_tools` session. It may still use Playwright/Chromium independently when the isolated runtime image supports
that, and rendering tools can continue to use Chromium for one-shot PDF/PNG/HTML rendering. That browser state is
separate from the ReAct decision-loop browser session.

## Browser Feedback

The backend listens to Playwright page events:

- `console`: saved as `console_errors` when type is `error` or `warning`.
- `pageerror`: saved as `page_errors`.
- `requestfailed`: saved as `request_failures`.

Every browser action returns current page state:

- URL
- title
- document ready state
- visible body text preview
- DOM controls summary
- recent diagnostics
- optional screenshot artifact

This means an action has observable effects even without screenshot capture. Use screenshots only when visual layout,
canvas/SVG state, or responsive rendering must be inspected; screenshots add multimodal tokens.

If the browser tool itself fails, for example because a local `fi:` file cannot be resolved, ReAct renders the
`tc:` result with `status: error` and an `error` object containing `code`, `message`, and `where`.

## Screenshot Storage

Screenshots are written under `OUTPUT_DIR`, hosted with the normal tool artifact helper using `emit=false`, and returned as internal file descriptors:

```json
{
  "path": "fi:turn_x.outputs/browser_screenshots/123_main.png",
  "logical_path": "fi:turn_x.outputs/browser_screenshots/123_main.png",
  "artifact_path": "fi:turn_x.outputs/browser_screenshots/123_main.png",
  "physical_path": "turn_x/outputs/browser_screenshots/123_main.png",
  "filename": "123_main.png",
  "mime": "image/png",
  "kind": "file",
  "visibility": "internal",
  "size_bytes": 91234,
  "full_page": true
}
```

They are not returned inline as base64 in the JSON payload. ReAct renders the hosted internal `fi:` screenshot as a file block for multimodal model inspection and does not emit it to the user.

## Local File Resolution

Browser tools can open runtime files by:

- `fi:<turn>.outputs/...`
- `fi:<turn>.files/...`
- `fi:<turn>.attachments/...`
- `OUTPUT_DIR`-relative paths
- `WORKDIR`-relative paths

The backend resolves these to local file URLs only when the resolved file is under allowed runtime roots.

This is intentionally narrower than arbitrary host file access.

## Cleanup and Canceled Turns

There are four cleanup mechanisms:

1. Explicit close:

   ```json
   {"tool_id": "browser_tools.close", "params": {}}
   ```

2. Turn lifecycle cleanup:

   The chatbot workflow and processor finalizer close the current turn browser session after normal completion,
   managed turn errors, watchdog timeouts, and processor cancellation. This is the primary cleanup path for ReAct
   turns.

3. Opportunistic cleanup:

   Each new browser session access closes stale sessions first.

4. Timer cleanup:

   When at least one browser session exists, the backend starts a lightweight janitor task. It wakes periodically
   and closes idle BrowserContexts. If all sessions are closed, the janitor exits.

The timer path is a fallback for hard kills, process interruptions, or any path where the lifecycle/finalizer cleanup
does not run. If a turn is killed before cleanup can run, its BrowserContext is still closed after it becomes idle.

Current backend defaults:

```text
session_idle_ttl: 30 minutes
janitor_interval: 60 seconds
max_sessions: 64
```

These are backend constants today. If we need runtime configurability, move them under the ReAct `ai.react`
configuration block and pass them through the same runtime config path used for context caps.

## Playwright Installation

`shared_browser.py` can auto-install Chromium on first use when configured with `auto_install_browser=True`.

The auto-install path now has a bounded timeout. If Chromium cannot be installed quickly, startup fails with a
managed error instead of hanging indefinitely.

Recommended production behavior:

- Install browser binaries in the image or runtime environment ahead of time.
- Use `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` or the image default path consistently.
- Treat auto-install as a developer convenience, not the normal production path.

## Concurrency Model

The shared Chromium process can serve multiple users. Isolation relies on BrowserContexts:

```text
Browser process
  BrowserContext: turn A / user A
    Page: main
    Page: reference
  BrowserContext: turn B / user B
    Page: main
```

The session map is guarded by an asyncio lock. Page event callbacks append bounded diagnostics to the owning
session. Event logs are capped to avoid unbounded memory growth.

## Future Extensions

Likely next tools:

- Screenshot pixel checks or visual diff helpers.
- Selector assertions.
- Accessibility tree snapshot.
- Network request inspection by URL pattern.
- Console log retrieval with filters.
- Mobile viewport presets.
- Dedicated search/browser tabs once web browsing moves through Playwright.
