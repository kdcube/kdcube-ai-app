# Email SDK Integration

The email SDK integration contains reusable provider and processing mechanics
that bundles can import from:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations import email
```

The SDK owns email protocol mechanics. The bundle still owns product policy:
who may connect accounts, how an account is exposed in UI, which task or agent
uses the mailbox, and how outputs are delivered.

External provider setup is documented separately in
`email-external-prereq-README.md`. Keep this article focused on the SDK
surface and bundle integration points.

kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.delivery
  delivery.py      report delivery orchestration shared by task/report bundles:
                   email send, Telegram send, attachment resolution, and
                   delivered-file metadata
```

`__init__.py` re-exports the stable bundle-facing symbols for normal imports.

The SDK store is the canonical reusable account store. Bundles should not keep
their own parallel `EmailAccountStore` wrapper unless they are only providing a
backward-compatible import shim. Product-specific behavior belongs in policy
hooks, task code, or UI handlers, not in duplicated provider/account storage
code.

## Account Store

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.email import EmailAccountStore

store = EmailAccountStore(storage_root, user_id=user_id, bundle_id=bundle_id)
account = store.upsert_account({
    "provider": "google",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "scope": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
})
store.set_tokens(account["account_id"], {"access_token": "...", "refresh_token": "..."})
```

`EmailAccountStore` stores account metadata under the bundle storage root and
stores secrets through the KDCube user-secret API. Account JSON records keep
only metadata and a `has_token` flag; OAuth tokens and iCloud app passwords do
not live in account metadata files.

The store is provider-neutral. Provider-specific checks happen through:

```python
await ensure_email_account_access(store=store, entrypoint=entrypoint, account=account)
```

## Delivery Formatting

`delivery.py` contains provider-neutral email message-building helpers. Bundles
can use them from report delivery tools, scheduled task jobs, or custom route
handlers:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.email import (
    build_email_message,
    markdown_to_email_html,
    split_email_addresses,
)

msg = build_email_message(
    sender_email="reports@example.com",
    recipients=split_email_addresses("user@example.com"),
    subject="Daily report",
    body_text="# Summary\n\n- Item one",
    attachments=[{"filename": "report.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf", "data": pdf_bytes}],
)
```

The SDK helper renders Markdown into conservative email HTML, adds a plain-text
fallback, and attaches byte payloads. It does not decide who may receive a
report, which account to send from, or whether delivery should go through Gmail,
iCloud, Telegram, or another surface.

## Report Delivery

`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.delivery` contains the reusable
report-delivery path that task/report bundles commonly need:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.delivery import send_report

result = await send_report(
    entrypoint=entrypoint,
    storage_root=storage_root,
    user_id=user_id,
    bundle_id=bundle_id,
    conversation_id=conversation_id,
    delivery_target="both",
    subject="Daily report",
    body_markdown=markdown,
    email_account="user@example.com",
    recipient_email="user@example.com",
    attachment_paths="/work/out/report.pdf",
)
```

The helper owns generic mechanics:

- selecting a connected email account
- enforcing Gmail send scopes
- sending through Gmail or iCloud
- resolving local, hosted, URL, key, and base64 file items
- enforcing attachment byte limits
- sending Telegram text/documents/photos
- returning delivered-file artifact metadata with `visibility: user`

Bundles still own policy inputs: storage root, target user, bundle id, current
conversation id, which delivery target is appropriate, and which attachments
should be sent.

## Account Settings Operations

`settings.py` provides reusable account-management operations for bundle UIs
and Telegram Mini Apps. The bundle supplies its storage root, user resolution,
and optional Telegram identity resolver:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.email import settings as email_settings

email_settings.configure_email_settings(
    storage_root_or_error=storage_root,
    target_user_id=target_user_id,
    resolve_identity=telegram_widget_auth.resolve_identity,
    bundle_id="my.bundle@1-0",
)

payload = email_settings.status(entrypoint, user_id="user-a")
oauth = email_settings.start_oauth(entrypoint, request=request)
```

The operations cover:

- `status(...)`
- `start_oauth(...)`
- `callback(...)`
- `disconnect(...)`
- `connect_app_password(...)`
- Telegram Web App variants that first resolve Telegram `initData`

Typical bundle shape:

```text
bundle endpoint / widget action
  -> email_settings.<operation>(entrypoint, ...)
       -> target_user_id hook supplied by bundle
       -> EmailAccountStore from SDK
       -> Gmail OAuth or iCloud account operation from SDK
```

This keeps UI routing and role policy in the bundle while the account mechanics
stay in the SDK.

## Gmail OAuth

The SDK provides Gmail OAuth URL construction, callback exchange, token refresh,
profile fetch, and provider error normalization:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.email import (
    build_google_authorize_url,
    exchange_google_code,
    fetch_google_profile,
)
```

The bundle supplies the `entrypoint` so descriptor values and bundle-scoped
secrets can be resolved:

```text
integrations.email.google.client_id
integrations.email.google.client_secret
integrations.email.google.scopes
integrations.email.oauth.redirect_uri
integrations.email.oauth.state_secret
```

Provider failures are returned as structured payloads with `code`, `category`,
`provider`, `operation`, and provider diagnostics when available.

## Message Access

Use provider-specific functions when the provider is known:

```python
await fetch_google_messages(...)
await fetch_google_message(...)
await fetch_google_attachment(...)

await fetch_icloud_messages(...)
await fetch_icloud_message(...)
await fetch_icloud_attachment(...)
```

Use provider-dispatch functions when the caller only has an account record:

```python
await fetch_email_messages(...)
await fetch_email_message(...)
await fetch_email_attachment(...)
```

The normalized message shape includes:

```text
message_id, thread_id, from, to, subject, date, internal_date,
snippet, body_excerpt, body_truncated, label_ids, attachments[]
```

Attachments are represented with:

```text
attachment_id, filename, mime_type, size_bytes, part_id
```

## Attachment Materialization

`attachments.py` turns selected email attachments into current-turn ReAct file
artifacts:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.email import (
    materialize_email_attachments_for_current_turn,
)

result = await materialize_email_attachments_for_current_turn(
    entrypoint=entrypoint,
    store=store,
    artifact_scope=artifact_scope,
    account="user@example.com",
    selections=[{"message_id": "m-1", "attachment_id": "att-1"}],
    visibility="visible",
)
```

The SDK performs provider fetch, base64 decode, filename/mime normalization,
and artifact writes. The bundle decides which messages or attachments are
selected and whether the resulting files are user-visible.

## Process User Emails

`process_user_emails(...)` is the shared high-level mailbox processing entry:

```python
result = await process_user_emails(
    entrypoint=entrypoint,
    storage_root=storage_root,
    user_id=user_id,
    bundle_id=bundle_id,
    tenant=tenant,
    project=project,
    account="user@example.com",
    gmail_query="after:2026/05/01 before:2026/05/02",
    instruction="Find customer escalations.",
)
```

It selects the connected account, fetches candidate messages, records diagnostic
run metadata, and optionally delegates deeper analysis to Claude Code through
the Email MCP service when enabled by bundle config.

Run metadata is diagnostic. It does not hide old messages with a processed-id
ledger; task-specific future-run decisions belong to the task or MCP processor.

## Email MCP Service

`mcp.py` provides a short-lived, task-scoped MCP service for external processors
such as Claude Code:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.email import (
    build_email_mcp_app,
    create_email_mcp_run,
    verify_email_mcp_token,
)

prepared = create_email_mcp_run(
    entrypoint=entrypoint,
    storage_root=storage_root,
    user_id=user_id,
    task_id=task_id,
    execution_id=execution_id,
    account=account,
    mailbox="INBOX",
    gmail_query="after:2026/05/01",
)
```

The run document records the selected account, mailbox/query, task/execution
identity, TTL, and bundle id. The signed token is accepted only for that run.

The MCP app exposes email tools for the processor and writes the processor
result back to `EmailMCPRunStore`. The bundle can mount the app as a public or
internal route, but the SDK owns token verification and run lookup.

The reusable MCP pieces are:

```text
EmailMCPRunStore       run metadata and result storage
create_email_mcp_run   scoped run document + signed token
build_email_mcp_app    FastAPI MCP server bound to that run store
verify_email_mcp_token token verification for the scoped run
```

## Claude Code Processor

`claude.py` wires the Email MCP run into a Claude Code execution:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.email import (
    claude_code_enabled,
    run_email_processor_with_claude_code,
)
```

The processor creates an MCP run, starts Claude Code with an email-specific
prompt, reads the recorded MCP result, and returns a compact result payload.
If the Claude process times out or fails after recording a result, the recorded
result remains authoritative.

Bundle compatibility shims may set:

```python
EMAIL_CLAUDE_SKILLS_DESCRIPTOR
EMAIL_CLAUDE_BUNDLE_ROOT
```

to provide bundle-local skill descriptors while keeping the processor mechanics
in the SDK.

## Bundle Boundary

The SDK owns:

- Gmail OAuth and Gmail API request mechanics
- iCloud IMAP/SMTP mechanics
- account metadata and user-secret token storage helpers through
  `EmailAccountStore`
- provider error normalization
- attachment fetch and ReAct artifact materialization
- Email MCP run/token/service mechanics
- Claude Code email processing mechanics
- reusable account settings operations

The bundle owns:

- user/admin policy and UI routes
- which conversation or task requested the mailbox operation
- account selection policy when multiple accounts are connected
- generated reports, delivery policy, and task scheduling
- Telegram, web widget, or other product-specific presentation
