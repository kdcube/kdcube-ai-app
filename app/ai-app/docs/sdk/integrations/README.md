# SDK Integrations

SDK integrations are reusable provider and transport packages for bundles.

The bundle supplies product policy, route aliases, user-scope resolution, and
UI composition. The integration package supplies the mechanics.

| Integration | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [Email](email/README.md) | Gmail OAuth/API, iCloud IMAP/SMTP, account settings, attachment materialization, Email MCP, Claude Code email processing, and email delivery helpers. |
| [Telegram](telegram/README.md) | Webhooks, Bot API rendering, progress streaming, Mini App auth, user registry storage, widget operations, and signed downloads. |

For the broader bundle-builder selection map, start with
