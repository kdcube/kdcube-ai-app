# Canvas Pin Operations

The canvas is a board of pins. A pin is a proxy to one external or
canvas-owned object. The canvas owns the card, its placement, display cache,
comments, and board revision. The source subsystem owns the object behind the
pin.

The core rule is:

```text
one pin -> one canonical object ref
```

No secondary download handle, browser handle, signed URL, `ef:` transport
handle, or resolver-private path should be persisted on the card. If a file is
identified as `fi:...`, the canvas stores `fi:...` and only `fi:...`. Download,
preview, materialization, and rehost all go through the resolver registered for
`fi:`.

## Board Targeting

A pin operation lands on a board chosen in this order:

1. an explicit `canvas_id` on the operation,
2. otherwise the user's **last-active board** (set whenever the user switches
   boards in the Pin Board UI),
3. otherwise the default board.

This lets an agent pin to "the board the user is looking at" by simply omitting
`canvas_id`. Board lifecycle — create, archive (hidden from the default list,
recoverable), and delete (entry removed, artifacts purged) — is owned by the
canvas storage layer and surfaced through the Pin Board toolbar; archived and
deleted boards drop out of active resolution.

## Owned vs Foreign Refs

A pin's `object_ref` resolves through one of two tiers, picked by namespace
prefix:

- **Owned** (`cnv:`, `conv:`, `mem:`) — a concrete resolver on this surface
  knows the kind, preview, and open semantics directly.
- **Foreign** (a namespace another bundle owns, for example `acme:`) — the generic
  `NamedServiceCanvasObjectResolver` treats the ref as opaque and asks the owner
  bundle over the in-runtime bridge. It is additive (registered after the
  concrete resolvers, only for namespaces configured under
  `surfaces.as_consumer.ui.canvas.resolvers`) and
  never shadows owned refs.

See [Namespace Services](../../namespace-services/README.md) for the
provider/consumer contract behind foreign refs.

## Pin Shape

Some legacy provider fields still use `logical_path`/`storage_ref` in places.
The SDK-level contract should converge on `object_ref`; the old field names are
compatibility aliases for the same canonical resolver URI.

```json
{
  "id": "fi:conv_123.turn_2026-06-07-12-59-27-283.outputs/problem_statement.md",
  "kind": "file",
  "object_ref": "fi:conv_123.turn_2026-06-07-12-59-27-283.outputs/problem_statement.md",
  "logical_path": "fi:conv_123.turn_2026-06-07-12-59-27-283.outputs/problem_statement.md",
  "title": "problem_statement.md",
  "mime": "text/markdown",
  "display_cache": {
    "title": "problem_statement.md",
    "mime": "text/markdown",
    "summary": "Short display preview, if known."
  },
  "rect": {"x": 360, "y": 120, "w": 260, "h": 120},
  "placement": "placed"
}
```

For resolver-backed objects, the card id should be the canonical object ref.
This makes duplicate prevention deterministic:

- dragging the same `acme:ticket:<id>` again updates/restores the existing pin;
- dragging the same `fi:` again updates/restores the existing pin;
- dragging the same `mem:` again updates/restores the existing pin;
- dragging the same `repo:` or `so:` ref again updates/restores the existing pin.

Canvas-owned objects are the exception because the user creates a new object
first. Their ids are minted by the canvas-owned object host:

```text
cnv:.../ut_2026-06-07-13-20-10_a1b2  user text
cnv:.../ua_2026-06-07-13-20-10_a1b2  user attachment
cnv:.../at_2026-06-07-13-20-10_a1b2  assistant text
```

Canvas-owned storage uses `cnv:` refs, so the canvas subsystem owns the board
and canvas-object namespace.

## Board Operations

These operations belong to the canvas board, not to resolvers:

```text
move card
resize card
select card
multi-select cards
share selected/multi-selected cards as canvas focus
drag card to chat as the proxied object context
drag card to bin
restore card from bin
clean bin
drop an external object onto the board
edit canvas-owned text
edit card description
add card comment
```

The three text operations (canvas-owned text, description, comment) edit in
place through a shared markdown editor; see the board UI affordances in
[Canvas Module Guide](./canvas-module-guide-README.md).

All cards are draggable and droppable as board objects. Resolver registration
must not decide whether a card can be moved, resized, selected, dropped into
chat, or dropped into the bin.

The resolver only decides what can be done with the underlying object.

## Resolver Operations

Resolver actions are derived from functions available on the registered
resolver. There should not be a separately maintained static `actions` list.

Conceptually:

```python
class CanvasObjectResolver:
    namespace = "fi"

    async def describe(self, ctx, ref): ...
    async def preview(self, ctx, ref): ...
    async def open(self, ctx, ref, request): ...
    async def download(self, ctx, ref, request): ...
    async def rehost(self, ctx, ref, target): ...
```

If a resolver implements `download`, the UI can show download. If it does not,
download is hidden. Same for `open`, `preview`, and `rehost`.

The host exposes the operation as:

```text
canvas_object_action({object_ref, action, card_id?, canvas_id?, canvas_name?, story_id?, mime?})
```

The operation first resolves the namespace from `object_ref`, then dispatches
to the namespace resolver. The UI may ask for `capabilities`, but it should not
hardcode object behavior. Capabilities are live resolver facts, not canvas card
metadata.

Recommended operation meanings:

| Operation | Meaning | Typical result |
|---|---|---|
| `describe(ref)` | Return stable metadata for display cache | title, mime, size, summary, icon hint |
| `preview(ref)` | Return bounded renderable preview | text excerpt, image preview URL, object summary |
| `open(ref, request)` | Ask owning subsystem to focus/open the object | UI event, status, or unavailable result |
| `download(ref, request)` | Materialize downloadable bytes | stream response, URL, or short-lived browser handle |
| `rehost(ref, target)` | Copy bytes/object into another subsystem | new target-owned ref |

`download` is not a property stored on the pin. For a ReAct artifact, the flow
is:

```text
canvas card has object_ref=fi:...
user clicks Download
canvas server calls fi resolver download(ref)
fi resolver returns a response usable by the browser
```

For a provider attachment target, the flow is:

```text
canvas/chat source has object_ref=fi:...
user drops it on provider attachments
provider subsystem calls fi resolver rehost(ref, target=acme:ticket:<id>)
provider subsystem writes provider-owned bytes and returns acme:... attachment ref
```

The resulting provider attachment is not a canvas link. It is a new provider-owned
object.

## Ownership Rules

The card owns:

- `rect`;
- `placement`;
- selected/focused state;
- board comments;
- board description;
- display cache;
- timestamps for canvas revisioning;
- suggestion/bin state.

The source subsystem owns:

- object bytes;
- object schema;
- object permissions;
- object lifecycle;
- exact object preview/download/open behavior;
- rehost rules.

This split matters for collaboration. An assistant may suggest new cards,
suggest content edits for canvas-owned text, or suggest description/comment
updates on proxy cards. It should not mutate the underlying object through the
canvas unless it calls that object's own subsystem tool, such as provider tools for
`acme:` objects.

## Unknown Refs

Unknown refs are still valid pins. They should render as unresolved proxy
cards:

```json
{
  "kind": "object.ref",
  "object_ref": "abc:some/external/object",
  "display_cache": {
    "title": "abc:some/external/object"
  }
}
```

The board can move, resize, focus, comment, and delete the card. Object-level
actions are hidden until a resolver for `abc:` is registered.

## Namespace Resolver Contract

For namespace-owned refs, canvas is only the proxy host. The resolver/provider
owns object semantics:

```text
Canvas.card.object_ref
  -> namespace resolver capabilities for that exact ref
  -> canvas renders buttons from capabilities
  -> user clicks a button
  -> canvas calls object_action({object_ref, action, ...})
  -> resolver/provider executes action against that same object_ref
```

Resolvers must make capabilities specific to the full URI, not only the
namespace. A namespace can contain subnamespaces and object kinds:

```text
task:issue:<issue_id>                         -> issue object actions
task:issue:attachment:<issue_id>/attachments/... -> attachment object actions
```

The provider decides that the first ref can open the issue editor while the
second can download bytes or open the parent issue focused on the attachment.
Canvas does not infer this from `task`; it only forwards the full ref and renders
the returned capabilities.

## Error Handling

Resolver failures should not remove pins. A failed `preview`, `open`,
`download`, or `rehost` returns a bounded status:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "resolver_unavailable",
  "namespace": "fi",
  "object_ref": "fi:...",
  "message": "File resolver is not available in this bundle."
}
```

The UI may show this on the card or in a toast, but the card remains in the
canvas revision. Pins are durable user context, even when the resolver is
temporarily unavailable.
