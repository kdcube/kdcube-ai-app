# Canvas SDK Solution

`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.canvas` is the reusable collaborative
board component for bundles that need a live spatial working surface. The
canvas stores pins/cards, annotations, layout, trash state, and revisions. The
object represented by a pin remains owned by its original subsystem.

The SDK owns canvas mechanics. The composition bundle owns product routes,
auth, mounted widgets, and subsystem resolver registration.

For the bundle-level mounting checklist, read
[Bundle Subsystem Integration](../../bundle/bundle-subsystem-integration-README.md).
Canvas integration is a full subsystem integration: API routes, Data Bus
handler, UI component source, tools, instructions, event policies, resolver
registry, storage config, visibility, and tests must be wired together.

                          generic canvas focus policy ids
  ui/component/src        Reusable React canvas board component source
```

The SDK package does not know task-tracker issue semantics, memory semantics,
or ReAct artifact download transport details. It only stores canonical refs and
routes object actions through registered resolvers. Bundles configure storage
names, event ids, and Data Bus subject names through `bundle_props.canvas`; the
tool implementation remains in the SDK.

## Storage Model

A canvas document is a versioned board state:

```json
{
  "schema": "kdcube.canvas.v1",
  "canvas_id": "canvas:<user-or-scope>:main",
  "canvas_name": "main",
  "revision": 17,
  "bounds": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 1680, "h": 1080},
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": "U_2026-06-08-09-10-11_ab12",
      "kind": "user.text",
      "title": "Observation",
      "logical_path": "ext:<bundle-owned-canvas-object>",
      "rect": {"x": 40, "y": 40, "w": 238, "h": 112}
    },
    {
      "id": "T_2026-06-08-09-12-02_cd34",
      "kind": "issue.ref",
      "logical_path": "task:issues/issue_2026-06-08-09-01-20",
      "rect": {"x": 320, "y": 120, "w": 260, "h": 120}
    }
  ]
}
```

The card identity for canvas editing is `id`. The represented object identity
is the canonical ref, normally in `logical_path`, `ref`, or `object_ref`
depending on the client payload. A subsystem object keeps its original
namespace when pinned:

| Object | Canonical ref kept by canvas | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ReAct/chat artifact | `fi:conv_<conversation>/turn_.../outputs/file.md` | ReAct artifact layer |
| Memory | `mem:<memory-id>` | Memory module |
| Task issue | `task:issues/<issue-id>` | Task subsystem |
| Canvas user text/upload | `ext:<bundle-canvas-object>` or future `cnv:<object>` | Canvas storage owner |
| Knowledge/source row | `ks:<article>` or `so:<source>` | Knowledge/source subsystem |

Canvas does not rehost external objects just because they are pinned. Rehosting
is an explicit action owned by the target subsystem, for example attaching a
chat file to a task.

## Configuring Storage

The SDK `CanvasStore` is configurable so a composition bundle can preserve its
existing storage and event names while using SDK mechanics:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.canvas.storage import CanvasStore

store = CanvasStore.from_scope(
    scope,
    bundle_id="my-bundle@1-0",
    artifact_prefix="canvas",
    origin_prefix="my_bundle.canvas",
    state_event_source_id="my_bundle.canvas.state",
    ui_event_type="my_bundle.canvas.patch.applied",
    artifact_resolver_name="my_bundle.canvas_artifacts",
    handoff_resolver_names={
        "task": "my_bundle.issue_story",
    },
)
```

Use `handoff_resolver_names` only to name resolvers owned elsewhere. It is not
a place to implement object semantics.

## Resolver Ownership

Canvas has a resolver registry because pins are object proxies. The resolver
for a ref namespace owns object actions:

```text
canvas.object_action(ref="task:issues/...", action="open")
  -> namespace_for_ref("task:issues/...") == "task"
  -> task resolver handles open
  -> task widget decides dirty-state behavior
```

Core contract:

| Canvas responsibility | Resolver responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Store card rect, title cache, description, comments, trash state, revision. | Interpret the canonical object ref. |
| Call `resolver.object_action(...)` for preview/open/download/rehost. | Return bounded preview, UI event, download transport, or rehost result. |
| Keep unknown refs as valid unresolved pins. | Register later and make those pins live. |
| Render board map/legend for ReAct through canvas policies. | Provide domain-specific representation for the underlying object. |

Built-in SDK resolver support:

| Resolver | Namespace | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BundleExtArtifactResolver` | `ext:` | Reads canvas-owned/bundle-owned artifact refs from bundle artifact storage. |
| `NamespaceHandoffResolver` | any | Declares that another subsystem owns the namespace. |
| `CanvasObjectResolverRegistry` | all | Dispatches actions to registered resolvers by namespace. |

The task-tracker bundle registers `task:` and `mem:` by importing their owning
modules. Canvas does not duplicate those implementations.

## ReAct Integration

Canvas contributes stable additional instructions:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.canvas.instructions import (
    CANVAS_REACT_ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS,
)
```

The instructions explain:

- `[CANVAS BOARD]` ANNOUNCE is live board state.
- `[CANVAS FOCUSED CONTEXT]` is turn-local selected/multi-selected card
  context for batch operations on the attached board.
- Individual pins dragged from canvas into chat render as their proxied objects
  (`task:`, `mem:`, `fi:`, `ext:`, etc.), not as canvas-focus events.
- `canvas.read` is for exact hidden state.
- `canvas.patch` is the only agent write path.
- Agents do not move or resize existing cards.
- Proxy card underlying objects stay owned by their source subsystem.

`tools_core.py` is the reusable implementation behind ReAct tools:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.canvas.tools_core import (
    patch_canvas_for_agent,
    read_canvas_for_agent,
)
```

A bundle still defines its own SK plugin class and event-source policy ids:

```python
class CanvasTools:
    @event_source(event_source_id="{alias}.patch", policies=[...])
    @kernel_function(name="patch", description="...")
    async def patch(...):
        result = await patch_canvas_for_agent(
            tool_scope=scope(),
            store=CanvasStore.from_scope(scope(), bundle_id=BUNDLE_ID),
            bundle_id=BUNDLE_ID,
            data_bus_subject="my_bundle.canvas.patch",
            operations=operations,
            canvas_name=canvas_name,
            base_revision=base_revision,
            event_agent_id="main",
            event_surface="canvas",
        )
        ...
```

This split keeps SDK mechanics reusable while allowing each bundle to choose
its tool alias, policy ids, and agent-facing wording.

## Event Policy Integration

Canvas contributes generic ReAct projection helpers:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.canvas.events.policies import (
    append_canvas_tool_fact_block,
    produce_canvas_announce_blocks,
    project_canvas_state_blocks,
    project_canvas_tool_result_blocks,
)
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.canvas.events.focus_policies import (
    produce_canvas_focus_announce_blocks,
    project_canvas_focus_blocks,
)
```

The SDK also registers default generic policy ids such as
`canvas.timeline_projection.state`, `canvas.announce.board_map`, and
`canvas.announce.focus`. A composition bundle can use those ids directly, or it
can keep bundle-specific ids and wrap the helpers:

```python
@timeline_projection_policy(event_policy_id="my_bundle.timeline_projection.canvas_state")
def my_canvas_state_policy(timeline, *, source, react_phase="timeline_projection", **kwargs):
    return project_canvas_state_blocks(
        timeline,
        source=source,
        react_phase=react_phase,
        policy_prefix="my_bundle",
        default_event_source_id="my_bundle.canvas.state",
        canvas_meta_keys=("my_bundle_canvas", "canvas"),
        **kwargs,
    )
```

This is the intended SDK boundary:

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Canvas SDK policies | Text shape for `[CANVAS STATE]`, `[CANVAS BOARD]`, `[CANVAS FOCUS]`, and `[CANVAS FOCUSED CONTEXT]`. Focus means selected/multi-selected cards on a board. |
| Composition bundle wrappers | Event-source ids, event-policy ids, storage prefixes, and compatibility metadata keys. |
| Domain resolvers | Object-specific previews, open/download/rehost actions for refs such as `task:`, `mem:`, `fi:`, and `ks:`. |

## Data Bus Integration

`patch_canvas_for_agent(...)` first tries `comm.data_bus.publish_and_wait(...)`
when the runtime provides it. If no data-bus publisher exists, it falls back to
direct `store.patch(...)`. The subject is supplied by the composition bundle:

```text
subject = "<bundle>.canvas.patch"
object_ref = "canvas:<scope>:<name>"
```

The bundle-side data-bus handler must apply the same SDK `api.patch(...)` or
`store.patch(...)` path so UI, tools, and REST operations create the same
revision shape.

## UI Component

The SDK ships source for a reusable React component:

```text
sdk/solutions/canvas/ui/component/src
  CanvasBoard.tsx
  canvasModel.ts
  canvasTypes.ts
  contextTypes.ts
  ingress.ts
  ingressBridge.ts
```

The component expects bundle-provided operations:

```ts
type CanvasRead = (payload: CanvasReadInput) => Promise<CanvasReadResponse>
type CanvasPatch = (payload: CanvasPatchInput) => Promise<CanvasPatchResponse>

<CanvasBoard
  canvas={canvas}
  selectedCanvasName="main"
  patchCanvas={patchCanvas}
  readCanvas={readCanvas}
  onAttachCanvas={...}
  onAttachCard={...}
  onDropContext={...}
/>
```

The UI component does not know how to download a `fi:` file or open a
`task:` issue. It sends object actions to the bundle, and the bundle dispatches
through the resolver registry.

## Task-Tracker Adapter Pattern

Task-tracker currently keeps thin adapter modules:

```text
task-tracker@1-0/canvas/storage.py          -> SDK CanvasStore with task-tracker defaults
task-tracker@1-0/canvas/api.py              -> SDK canvas API re-exports
task-tracker@1-0/canvas/events/resolver.py  -> SDK resolver registry plus task handoff
task-tracker@1-0/canvas/tools.py            -> local SK decorators, SDK tool core execution
task-tracker@1-0/events/canvas_policies.py  -> task ids wrapping SDK canvas policy helpers
task-tracker@1-0/events/canvas_focus_policies.py
                                             -> task ids wrapping SDK focus helpers
```

This lets existing task-tracker routes and tests stay stable while the reusable
canvas code moves to the SDK. Task-specific object resolvers remain in
task-tracker because `task:` is owned by the task subsystem, not by canvas.

## Integration Checklist

1. Create a store adapter with bundle-specific storage/event names.
2. Register resolver handoffs and implemented resolvers for mounted domains.
3. Expose bundle operations that call SDK `api.py`.
4. Expose ReAct `canvas.*` tools using SDK `tools_core.py` and local policy ids.
5. Add `CANVAS_REACT_ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS` to the agent instructions.
6. Mount the UI component and pass read/patch/object-action functions.
7. Keep cards as canonical refs; never store transport-only download handles as
   card identity.
