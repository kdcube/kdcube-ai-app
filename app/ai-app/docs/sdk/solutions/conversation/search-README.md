title: "Conversation Search"
summary: "One search engine over the conversation memory realm, three doors into it: the in-app agent (react.memsearch and the `conv` named service), external agents (the managed MCP surface served by the kdcube-services app), and people (a REST endpoint plus the chat-widget search UI). Covers the search model (user boundary ∩ scope ∩ time window ∩ targets), hybrid ranking with user-held rank weights, honest summary/notes labeling, snippet materialization with its retrieval-row fallback, and the explicit identity contract."

# Conversation Search

Conversations are one of the user's **memory realms** — what was actually said
in chat, this conversation or across earlier ones. One engine searches that
realm: `run_conversation_search(...)` in
`sdk/solutions/conversation/api.py`. Three doors open onto it — the in-app
agent, external agents over the managed MCP surface, and people through the
chat widget — and every door runs the same candidates, the same ranking, the
same identity boundary. The realm is **read-only** through search: conversations
are recovered, never written.

## The search model

A search's candidate set is an intersection of four constraints:

```text
candidates = user boundary  ∩  scope  ∩  time window  ∩  targets
```

- **User boundary** — always on, never optional. `context.user_id` is a hard
  isolation filter; a search can only ever see the searched user's own
  conversations. A `bundle_id` on the context additionally confines results to
  one app's conversations when set.
- **Scope** — which conversations:
  - `conversation` — only the current conversation (`context.conversation_id`).
  - `user` — all of the same user's conversations; the current conversation id
    then only anchors cross-conversation ref labeling.
  - `agent` — user-wide, narrowed to turns owned by the current agent
    (`context.agent_id` becomes a filter; the backend still sees `user` scope).
- **Time window** — `from_ts` (inclusive) / `to_ts` (exclusive), plus a `days`
  horizon (default 365 for topic search, 3650 for catalog/temporal requests).
- **Targets** — which content kinds inside a turn:
  `user` (prompts and follow-ups), `assistant` (replies), `summary` (working
  summaries), `attachment` (the user's **uploaded** attachments, by their
  indexed summaries), `notes` (the assistant's internal notes). The realm
  covers the user's own uploads; bot-produced files live elsewhere.

### Topic search and catalog browse

The engine routes each request one of two ways:

- **Hybrid topic search** (`effective_mode="hybrid"`) — runs whenever `query`
  is set and no catalog signal is present. Ranked retrieval, described below.
- **Catalog modes** (`ordinal`, `temporal`, `timeline`) — deterministic
  turn-catalog lookups with no ranking. A **blank query with a time window is a
  temporal browse**: "show me what happened that week" without naming a topic.
  An `ordinal` fetches turn N; no query and no window is a timeline overview.
  A query sent alongside catalog signals is ignored with an explicit warning in
  the response. A blank query with no catalog signal is a contract error
  (`missing_query`); the REST door turns it into a 400.

Results are turn-level hits carrying recovery paths (`conv:ar:…`,
`conv:ws:…`), snippets, and ranking telemetry — never the raw transcript. In
the hybrid path at most **two hits per source conversation** survive
(`MAX_HITS_PER_CONVERSATION`), so one repetitive conversation cannot
monopolize the top-k; the engine over-fetches from the retriever to refill the
requested limit after that cap.

## Ranking: three arms, one fusion, user-held weights

Topic search is `scoring_mode="rrf_hybrid"` in
`sdk/context/retrieval/ctx_rag.py::search_context`: three parallel retrievers —
**semantic** (embedding cosine), **lexical** (BM25F over `search_tsv`), and
**trigram** (fuzzy word similarity) — fused by Reciprocal Rank Fusion and
lifted by recency. The full retrieval mechanics (analyzers, anchor discipline,
fusion math, why three arms) live in
[Conversational Memory Search](../../memory/conversational-memory-search-README.md);
this doc covers what is layered on top.

### Rank weights

Callers may hold the fusion knobs. `rank_weights` is an optional
`{semantic, lexical, recency}` mapping of multipliers, normalized by
`ctx_rag.normalize_rank_weights` — unknown keys and non-numeric values are
dropped, survivors are clamped to **[0, 2]**:

```text
rrf_score   = w_sem · 1/(k + sem_rank)
            + w_lex · 1/(k + lex_rank)
            + w_lex · 1/(k + trgm_rank)          k = 60
final_score = rrf_score × (1 + w_rec · L · recency)   L = 1.0, half-life 7 days
```

- `semantic` scales the semantic arm's RRF contribution.
- `lexical` scales **both** the lexical and trigram arms — they are two faces
  of the same text-match signal.
- `recency` scales the recency lift.
- Every weight defaults to **1.0**, and all-1.0 (or omitting the knob entirely)
  reproduces the unweighted fusion **byte-identically** — the knob is only
  forwarded to the backend when set, so backends without it keep working.

### Honest summary and notes labeling

`summary` and `notes` are **tag-scoped arms**, not role aliases. Working
summaries are indexed as assistant-role rows tagged `kind:working.summary`;
the summary arm scopes to those tags, so a summary-targeted search matches
summary content only — never plain assistant completions. Notes ride artifact
rows tagged `kind:react.note`. Hits produced by such an arm are labeled with
the **target vocabulary** (`matched_via_role: "summary"` / `"notes"`), and
their snippets carry the same role — so UIs and agents see what was actually
matched, not the storage role it happens to ride on.

## Snippets and the retrieval-row fallback

For each hybrid hit the engine fetches the turn log and materializes snippets
per requested target: user prompt blocks, assistant completions, the
`conv.working.summary` block, note blocks, attachment text/summary/meta. Each
snippet carries `role`, `path`, `text`, `ts`.

Turn-log materialization is best-effort. When the turn log is unavailable or
yields no text, the hit is **not dropped**: the retrieval row's own matched
text (fetched `with_payload`) ships as a single snippet labeled with the
matched target vocabulary and `meta.source: "retrieval_row"`. The condition is
loud, twice — a response-level warning ("turn log snippets unavailable for N
hit(s)…") and a `[conversation.search]` log warning naming the turn ids, so a
mis-wired conversation store is visible, never silent.

## Identity: the explicit calling context

`run_conversation_search` reads **no ambient contextvars**. It takes an
explicit `ConversationSearchContext` and a search backend:

| Field | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `user_id` | The searched user. Always a hard isolation filter. |
| `conversation_id` | Confines a `conversation`-scope search; anchors cross-conversation ref labeling in `user` scope. |
| `turn_id` | Current-turn metadata for labeling produced blocks — not a search filter. |
| `bundle_id` | The app scope; the index filters by it when present. |
| `agent_id` | A filter only under `scope="agent"`. |
| `tenant` / `project` / `schema` | Provenance only — see below. |

Tenant and project are **not** `WHERE` filters. Isolation is the Postgres
**schema name**, derived from tenant + project when the search backend is
constructed; the backend handed to the engine is already bound to one. Each
door therefore supplies the same two seams: a **context** built from its own
authority (runtime state, named-service request auth, or the HTTP session) and
a **backend** bound to the right schema
(`search_backend.make_conversation_search_backend`).

## Three doors

### 1. The in-app agent

The ReAct tool `react.memsearch` is a thin caller: it builds the context with
`ConversationSearchContext.from_runtime_ctx(...)` — the only place identity is
read off runtime state — and passes the live context browser as the backend.
Agents can also reach the realm through the `conv` named service with the
standard named-service tools (see the
[named-services tools doc](../../tools/named-services-tools-README.md)):

```text
named_services.search_objects(
  namespace="conv",
  query="<topic>",
  filters={"targets": ["user", "assistant", "summary"], "scope": "user"},
)
```

Empty `query` with `ordinal` or a `from`/`to` window does the deterministic
catalog lookup instead of topic search.

### 2. External agents, through the managed MCP surface

The provider (`sdk/solutions/conversation/named_service.py`, provider id
`sdk.conversation`) mirrors the memory provider's shape: decorated class,
spec factory, search scopes, `intro`. The **kdcube-services** app registers it,
supplying the two seams — `conversation_search_context_from_ns` as the context
factory and a pooled `make_conversation_search_backend` bound per request to
the caller's tenant/project — and publishes `conv` on its `named_services` MCP
surface. From there the realm is reachable by connected external agents and by
generated code in isolated runtimes over the relay (see the
[isolated-runtime doc](../kdcube-services/named-services-from-isolated-runtime-README.md)).
The provider advertises read operations only and carries advisory grant hints
(`conversations:read`, `conversations:read:any_user` for selected-user access);
consent and enforcement live at the managed boundary, and registration follows
the [discovery registry](../../namespace-services/discovery-README.md) like
every other provider.

### 3. People: the REST door and the chat widget

`POST /api/cb/conversations/{tenant}/{project}/search`
(`apps/chat/ingress/conversations/search.py`) is the human door. Its contract:

- **The searched user is always the authenticated session user.** The route
  builds the context from the session and a pooled backend from the request's
  tenant/project; there is no way to name another user.
- **Scope** is `user` or `conversation`; conversation scope requires a
  `conversation_id` the session user owns (ownership is checked, 404
  otherwise).
- **Targets** are a non-empty subset of
  `{user, assistant, summary, attachment}`; unknown targets are a 400.
- **Time window** `from_ts`/`to_ts` (ISO 8601). Blank query **with** a window
  is the temporal browse; blank query **without** one is a 400.
- **`limit`** is 1..50; **`weights`** are the rank weights above, clamped
  server-side; **`bundle_id`** selects an app scope (validated against the
  registry; the tenant/project default when omitted).
- **Responses are enriched** with each hit conversation's title and last
  activity, so the widget needs no join round-trip. Enrichment is best-effort
  and never fails the search.
- **The semantic arm degrades, it never 500s.** Embedding failures are
  contained per arm inside the retriever, so lexical and trigram matching still
  answer; a missing model service behaves the same way.

The chat widget (`components-core/src/chat/conversationSearch.ts` +
`engine.searchConversations`; `components-react` feature
`chat/ui/features/conversations/`) fronts this endpoint in the conversations
sidebar. Nothing paid runs on typing: the **Titles** scope is a free local
filter over the chat list, and the deep scopes (**This chat** / **All chats**)
run only on an explicit Search. The settings panel states the query
prerequisites — WHERE (scope) ∩ WHEN (presets or a custom date range) ∩ HOW
(kind opt-ins) — plus RANK sliders (0..2, step 0.1) with an ⓘ overlay that
teaches the three arms and RRF fusion on a worked example. Results group by
conversation, one card per snippet with its role chip, best-match marker,
"turn N of M" position, timestamp, and relative relevance; a blank-query date
range renders as a chronological browse. **Bring me here** loads the
conversation in the same chat view, scrolls to the turn's `data-turn-anchor`,
and flashes it — the search state is shared between the expanded sidebar and
the compact view.

## Observability

Every run logs one greppable `[conversation.search] start … done …` pair with
routing, mode, scope, counts, and clipped query — plus the fallback warning
above when snippet materialization degrades.
