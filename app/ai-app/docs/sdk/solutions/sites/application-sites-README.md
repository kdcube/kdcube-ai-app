# Application-Hosted Sites

An app can publish its normal `ui.main_view` as a website. Site registration is
app configuration in `bundles.yaml`; it is not an `assembly.yaml` setting and
is not interpreted by the CLI.

```yaml
- id: website@2026-07-12
  config:
    ui:
      main_view:
        site:
          enabled: true
          alias: workspace
          default: true
          hosts:
            - workspace.example.com
```

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Registers the already-built public main view as a site. |
| `alias` | Required unique route key. `_root` is reserved. |
| `default` | Optional root fallback. At most one enabled site may be default. |
| `hosts` | Optional exact hosts or `*.example.com` patterns used before the default. |

```text
request /sites/{alias}/{path}
        |
        +--> OpenResty stable forward
        +--> proc reads its immutable in-memory SiteCatalog
        +--> alias selects app without Redis or descriptor reads
        +--> standard app static lifecycle serves main view/assets

request /
        |
        +--> proc /api/integrations/site-root
        +--> host match
        +--> otherwise one default
        +--> otherwise configured platform chat route
```

OpenResty does not contain an app list. It only forwards `/` and `/sites/*` to
proc. This allows descriptor reloads to add, remove, or remap sites without
regenerating proxy configuration.

## Catalog Projection And Hot Routing

`bundles.yaml` remains the only authority. Proc projects only the routing fields
into a versioned catalog:

```text
bundles.yaml application config
        |
        | startup / application update / properties update
        v
validated ApplicationSiteCatalog
        |
        +--> Redis catalog snapshot + monotonic generation
        +--> Redis update channel
                     |
                     v
             each proc worker
             immutable in-memory catalog
                     |
                     v
             request-time host/alias lookup
```

The projection is derived and rebuildable. Redis distributes generations; it
is not the descriptor authority. A proc subscribes before loading the current
snapshot, then rejects delayed generations. Request handlers never read Redis,
parse YAML, or scan application properties.

Invalid aliases, duplicate aliases, duplicate host declarations, and multiple
defaults are rejected while compiling the catalog. The previous valid hot
catalog remains active until a valid replacement is published.

## Multipage And CDN Routing

Direct alias routes support files, directory indexes, and SPA fallback:

```text
/sites/docs/guide/index.html -> UI file guide/index.html
/sites/docs/guide/           -> UI directory guide/index.html
/sites/docs/client-route     -> index.html when no file exists
```

A CDN that owns `docs.example.com` forwards clean public paths by rewriting
them to the reserved host-selected surface while preserving the viewer host:

```text
viewer GET https://docs.example.com/guide/
  -> CDN rewrite/origin request
     /api/integrations/site-root/guide/
     Host or X-Forwarded-Host: docs.example.com
  -> proc hot catalog selects the application
  -> standard application UI storage serves the file
  -> CDN may cache the response
```

The CDN contains no site registry. Entry HTML and root-level non-hashed files
revalidate; hashed files below `assets/` are immutable for one year. This is the
same separation used by public content: the application declares content,
platform storage serves it, and the CDN only forwards and caches responses.

The site shell should read platform/auth browser configuration from
`/api/cp-frontend-config` and authenticated session truth from `/profile`.
Provider-specific login settings do not belong in site source.

The standard main-view static lifecycle supplies cache policy. Entry HTML and
root-level non-hashed files revalidate with `no-cache`; hashed files under
`assets/` are immutable for one year. A site does not use the public-content
publication registry merely to cache its shell.

The reference implementation is
`sdk/examples/bundles/website@2026-07-12`.
