# Public Content Solution (cdn-pub)

`kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/pub` is the platform solution that turns
app-declared content into **discoverable web artifacts**: crawlable HTML item
pages (real `<title>`/meta/body, no JavaScript), `rel=canonical` + Open
Graph + Twitter metadata, JSON-LD (declared `@type` + `BreadcrumbList`),
a per-alias `sitemap.xml` with accurate `lastmod`, `410 Gone` after
retraction, and a machine-readable sitemap descriptor list for host-site
federation.

Division of labor:

- **The app owns write time** — which items are public, their metadata, and
  the publish/update/retract decisions. How an app declares and drives the
  surface is the app-side contract:
  [Public Content Provider](../../bundle/public-content-provider-README.md).
- **This solution owns read time** — rendering and serving every
  discoverability artifact from the registry. No app-defined logic executes
  on the serving path (the route plumbing resolves the app and checks its
  declaration + config gate; it does not invoke app operations).
- **The site domain owns its root** — `robots.txt` and the top-level sitemap
  index stay host-owned; the solution provides what the host references.

## Module Map

```text
sdk/pub/
  model.py       PublicContentItem, alias config (catalogs, chrome), hot index models
  registry.py    tiered registry: durable records + hot serving tier
  render.py      item -> crawlable page (canonical/OG/Twitter + JSON-LD)
  pages.py       catalog listing pages, site chrome, article-page side rail
  sitemap.py     alias index -> sitemap.xml + host-federation descriptor
  service.py     config resolution, registry construction, load-time ensure,
                 the serving dispatcher (items, catalogs, search), Data Bus notifier
```

## The Item Model

`PublicContentItem`: `alias` + `slug` (clean permalink path, unique within
the alias — lowercase slug segments, a trailing `.html` normalizes away),
`title` / `summary` / `body_html` (the crawlable body; `headline_in_body`
marks an authored body that renders its own headline card, so the page
renderer skips its generated `<h1>`/summary — metadata and JSON-LD are
unaffected), `schema_type`
(JSON-LD `@type`) with `jsonld_extra` overrides, images/author/section/tags/
language, `kicker` (a short editorial badge shown on catalog/rail cards next
to the date, e.g. "Deep"), `published_at` / `lastmod`, and the publication
`state`: `published` or `retracted`.

The hot index entry carries bounded copies of the card-presentation fields
(`summary`, `tags`, `section`, `kicker`) alongside slug/title/dates/state, so
catalog and rail rendering never reads the durable backend. Growing the entry
bumps `INDEX_SCHEMA`, which rides the rebuild signature — one fleet-guarded
hot-tier rebuild per upgrade, no manual step.

Visibility vocabulary is deliberately narrow: **explicit public exposure +
publication state + tenant/project/app scoping**. There are no per-user
audience selectors on this surface.

## The Tiered Registry

Two storage tiers — no Postgres, no Redis:

```text
DURABLE (source of truth) — BundleArtifactStorage (local FS in dev, S3 in cloud):
  public_content/<alias>/items/<slug>.json     full item records
  public_content/<alias>/generation.json       monotonic mutation counter

HOT (what serving reads) — app storage root (local disk in dev, EFS in cloud):
  _public_content/<alias>/index.json           the per-alias index (sitemap source)
  _public_content/<alias>/items/<slug>.json    mirrored records (item pages)
  _public_content/<alias>/.index.signature     generation stamp
```

- **Crawler traffic reads only the hot tier**; the durable backend is never
  on the request path.
- The hot tier is **derived and rebuildable**: wipe it and the next app load
  rebuilds it from durable records.
- Consistency never compares timestamps — it compares the **generation
  counter** (no clock-skew sensitivity). `published_at`/`lastmod` are
  crawler-facing metadata carried through to the sitemap and JSON-LD.
- Retracted items keep their record so the URL answers **410** (with a
  `noindex` body) rather than 404 — the strongest "permanently removed"
  signal a crawler can get.

### Two concurrency moments

Mirrors the platform's prepared-data pattern
([Synchronization Mechanisms](../../../service/synch-mechanisms/critical-section-README.md)):

- **Moment A — load-time bootstrap/rebuild** (`ensure_hot_index()`): many
  workers across many instances race on app load. Guarded by
  `run_once_for_shared_bundle_storage`: lock-free signature fast path when
  the hot generation matches the durable generation; otherwise ONE
  fleet-wide owner rebuilds while waiters observe and skip. This is the
  durable→hot materialization — automatic, signature-guarded, operator-free.
  `get_item` additionally refills single items lazily on a hot-tier miss.
- **Moment B — runtime mutation** (`publish`/`update`/`retract`): serialized
  by an observed file lock on the shared hot tier, holding durable write →
  generation bump → hot update → signature in one critical section. Readers
  never take the lock; hot files are replaced atomically, so torn reads are
  impossible. **Bulk seeds must use `publish_many(items)`** — one lock
  acquisition and one generation bump for the whole batch; publishing N items
  one-by-one thrashes the shared lock and the durable generation RMW, and on
  EFS/S3 can starve concurrent publishers past their wait budget.

A publish landing during a rebuild is safe by generation re-check — worst
case one redundant rebuild, never a lost publish. All registry I/O runs off
the event loop (a blocked loop starves the once-lock heartbeat and manifests
as a duplicate builder).

### Multi-environment sharing

Two environments may share one durable store (same tenant/project/app
scope): **reads** propagate pull-on-load (a running env serves its own hot
copy until its next load/reload — serving never checks the durable backend
per request); **writes must come from one env** (the mutation lock lives on
each env's own shared filesystem, so cross-env writers are not serialized —
a recorded follow-up, not a current capability).

## Serving: The Reserved Route

Everything serves under the app's existing public namespace on the reserved
`__content__` segment (platform-owned; never dispatched to app operations):

```text
GET …/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/public/__content__
      → JSON descriptor list of enabled alias sitemaps (host federation)
GET …/public/__content__/{alias}/sitemap.xml
      → the per-alias sitemap (catalog pages + published items, accurate lastmod)
GET …/public/__content__/{alias}/{catalog-prefix}/sitemap.xml
      → a filtered sitemap for one configured catalog (catalog page + its items)
GET …/public/__content__/{alias}/{catalog-prefix}[?q=…&offset=…]
      → a configured catalog: the server-rendered listing page
GET …/public/__content__/{alias}/{slug…}
      → the crawlable item page (200), 410 when retracted, 404 unknown;
        chrome + side rail added when a configured catalog covers the slug
```

The handler reads the hot tier and renders with solution code. The route
plumbing resolves the app instance to consult its manifest (is the alias
declared?) and its props (is it enabled? what is the alias config?) — **a
content-provider app should therefore be a singleton** (`singleton: true`),
so crawler traffic reuses one instance instead of constructing a fresh
entrypoint per request.

The canonical URL is decoupled from the serving route: the alias config's
`canonical_base` (an operator-mapped clean prefix) drives `rel=canonical`,
JSON-LD `url`, and sitemap `<loc>`; when empty, serving-route URLs are used
so a local deployment still emits valid, testable artifacts.

## Catalogs: Browsable Folds With Search, Pagination, And Site Chrome

A **catalog** is a configured slug prefix of an alias served as a
server-rendered listing page — hero, card list (date, kicker badge, title,
summary, tag chips), fold pills linking sibling catalogs, a plain-GET search
form, and Newer/Older pagination. The same data renders as a **collapsible
side rail** on every item page under the prefix, so a reader browses the fold
without leaving the article. All of it is declarative — any app with a
public-content alias gets catalogs by adding config; no app code runs on the
browse path.

```yaml
public_content:
  news:
    enabled: true
    canonical_base: https://site.example/news
    # Use this instead of catalogs."" when the alias should open one fold.
    # root_redirect: engineering
    catalogs:                       # keyed by slug prefix
      "":                           # optional alias landing page
        title: All writing          # covers every item in the alias
        nav_label: All
      engineering:
        title: Engineering          # hero + rail title
        nav_label: Blogs            # short fold-pill label (defaults to title)
        eyebrow: KDCube Press
        subtitle: Deep dives from building the platform.
        accent: '#01BEB2'           # selection tints, buttons, links
        background: '#F6FAFA'       # page tint — per-fold color world
        border: '#D8ECEB'
        page_size: 10
      journal:
        title: Our Journal
        accent: '#0969DA'
        background: '#F4F9FF'
    chrome:                         # sticky site header on catalog + item pages
      brand_label: KDCube
      brand_href: /
      logo_url: /assets/logo.svg
      links:
        - { label: Home, href: '/' }
        - { label: Blog, href: '/news/engineering' }
```

`canonical_base` is deliberately absolute because it defines the indexed URL.
Same-site `brand_href`, `logo_url`, and navigation links should normally be
root-relative. This keeps one application descriptor valid on local, preview,
staging, and production hosts; absolute chrome links are for intentional
cross-site navigation.

Behavior and guarantees:

- **Everything renders from the hot index** — a catalog request costs index
  reads only, no durable backend, no app operation. Entries sort newest
  first by `published_at`; only `published` items appear.
- **An empty prefix is the alias landing catalog** — `""` serves directly at
  `canonical_base`, covers every published item in the alias, and carries its
  own canonical tag. It is included once in the alias sitemap, not repeated as
  a child-catalog sitemap.
- **A root redirect is the alternative landing policy** — set
  `root_redirect: <catalog-prefix>` to return an HTTP `302` from the alias root
  to that configured non-empty catalog. `root_redirect` and `catalogs.""` are
  mutually exclusive. This is app/runtime configuration; Caddy or CloudFront
  only maps the clean alias path to `public/__content__`.
- **Pagination is server-side** (`?offset=`, prev/next links) — crawlable,
  works without JavaScript.
- **Search** (`?q=`) is a plain GET form round-trip: results render
  server-side on the same page. Result pages carry `noindex`; the canonical
  browse pages stay the crawlable surface.
- **Per-fold color worlds**: `accent`/`background`/`border` theme each
  catalog (tints derive from the accent), so two open tabs are tellable
  apart at a glance. Selection states are transparent accent tints; the
  design language is shared between catalog rows and rail cards. Beyond the
  three shorthands, an application owns the full presentation — design
  tokens and app stylesheets declared per alias/catalog — see
  [public-content-styling-README](public-content-styling-README.md).
- **Item pages under a catalog** gain the chrome header, a "← catalog"
  crumb, and the rail (collapsible, persisted per browser; the rail search
  submits to the catalog page). The authored `body_html` renders byte-exact
  — chrome styles are namespaced (`kdcpub-`) and self-contained, so article
  CSS and chrome cannot bleed into each other. Canonical/OG/JSON-LD are
  unchanged. Items not covered by any catalog serve exactly as before.
- **Sitemaps**: each catalog page joins the alias sitemap with `lastmod` =
  newest covered item. Every configured catalog also receives a filtered
  child sitemap at `{catalog-prefix}/sitemap.xml`, generated from the same hot
  index. A host can submit that child sitemap independently for section-level
  Search Console coverage without duplicating content storage or publication.
- Shell failures degrade to the plain item page — an article never 500s
  because the index is momentarily unavailable.

### The provider search hook

Catalog search quality is the app's choice. By default `?q=` runs a lexical
match over the hot index (title/tags/summary). An app that owns a better
engine declares the hook:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.bundle_loader import public_content_search

@public_content_search(alias="news")
async def catalog_search(self, query: str, *, prefix: str = "", limit: int = 50) -> list[str]:
    """Return ordered result slugs for the catalog `prefix`."""
```

The platform calls the hook **in-process** (same runtime that hosts the app —
no CORS, no second HTTP hop, one server-rendered round-trip) and intersects
the returned slugs with the hot index, so only published, indexed items
render and the hook cannot leak beyond the public surface. A missing hook, an
exception, or an empty declaration degrades to the lexical match — search on
a public page never hard-fails.

### robots.txt and the top-level sitemap index

Host-level artifacts stay **host/deployment-owned**: `robots.txt` and the
site's sitemap **index** belong to whoever owns the domain root. The
solution provides what the host references — per-alias and per-catalog
sitemaps plus the descriptor list route. Each alias descriptor includes its
`catalog_sitemaps`, so a host generates index entries without scraping.

## Deployment Topology: Split Origin (host site + runtime)

The common production shape is a static host site on one domain and the
KDCube runtime on another. Public content is **anonymous** — no cookies, no
session — so unlike embedded widgets (which need same-origin auth cookies),
crawlable pages can be fronted across origins by pure CDN plumbing.

```text
crawler / shared link
   │
   ▼
site CDN (https://site.example)
   ├─ static site               → /, /docs/*, sitemap.xml, robots.txt
   ├─ ordered behavior /news/*  → custom origin = the runtime host
   └─ ordered behavior /blog/*  → the same runtime origin
        + viewer-request function rewriting the URI:
          /news/<rest> → /api/integrations/bundles/<t>/<p>/<app>/public/__content__/news/<rest>
          /blog/<rest> → /api/integrations/bundles/<t>/<p>/<app>/public/__content__/blog/<rest>
              │
              ▼
        runtime CDN → proxy (public location) → proc → __content__ handler → hot tier
```

The three configuration pieces, each in its owner's home:

| Piece | Owner | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canonical_base` | runtime descriptor (`public_content.<alias>` block) | one clean prefix per alias, such as `https://site.example/news` and `https://site.example/blog` |
| path behavior + URI-rewrite function | the **site's** CDN distribution | maps each clean alias prefix to its matching `__content__/<alias>` route |
| federation | the website build | one sitemap entry per enabled public alias, plus independently monitored catalog sitemaps when useful |

Result for a crawler: `robots.txt` → site sitemap index → the app's
runtime-generated sitemap (accurate `lastmod`) → clean item URLs, each
canonical to itself — all on the site's domain; the runtime host never
appears in the index.

Ordering note: ship the CDN behavior **before** (or together with) the
`robots.txt`/index federation lines — otherwise the index points crawlers at
a 404. Caching: item pages are anonymous and cacheable behind the behavior;
keep the sitemap path at low/no TTL so `lastmod` freshness is not masked
(CDN invalidation on publish is a designed pipeline hook, not built yet).

The raw serving URLs on the runtime host work with **no infra changes** (the
public proxy locations and gateway patterns already pass them) — use them
for staging verification before wiring the site-domain mapping. Local
development composes the same shape on one origin with any reverse proxy
performing the same rewrite.

## Gateway, Rate Limits, And Proxies

No special-casing is required — the reserved route rides the existing public
sub-path admission — but the operational consequences are worth knowing:

- **Admission**: the gateway guarded pattern `…/public/[^/]+(?:/.*)?` admits
  `__content__/…` as an anonymous public route; the OpenResty templates
  match only up to `/public/`, so multi-segment slugs pass every proxy
  shape.
- **Rate limits**: anonymous requests are limited per session (IP + user
  agent fingerprint) with the configured `rate_limits.proc.anonymous`
  budget. A crawler is one anonymous session per IP+UA; on 429 it backs
  off. Large content sets under aggressive crawling may warrant raising the
  anonymous budget or adding the sitemap route to
  `bypass_throttling_patterns.proc` in `gateway.yaml`.
- **Backpressure**: anonymous traffic sheds first
  (`anonymous_pressure_threshold`) — under load, crawler requests are
  deprioritized before user traffic.
- The Data Bus change notifier publishes server-side from proc, not through
  the Socket.IO ingress path, so `data_bus.publish` streaming limits do not
  apply to it.

## Change Notification (and its limits)

Every successful mutation can emit a `public_content.changed` Data Bus
message. It is a **notification hook only**: the durable registry and its
generation marker stay authoritative, and consumers (future
submission/syndication workers — IndexNow, feeds, CDN invalidation) must
tolerate missed messages by resyncing from durable records.

## Deferred (designed, not built)

The submission/syndication pipeline attaches to the notification and the
durable registry: IndexNow POST, RSS/Atom + WebSub, Search Console sitemap
registration, CDN invalidation on publish. Operator-owned credentials
(IndexNow key, Search Console property, analytics ids) live in platform
descriptors/secrets; when they become reusable provider credentials they
follow Connection Hub integration ownership. Also recorded: a dedicated
indexed table for very large content sets, and cross-environment write
coordination.
