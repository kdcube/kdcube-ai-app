# Event Domain Resolvers And Policies

This article defines how event-producing domains expose object semantics and
model-facing representations, and how a bundle composes several domains into
one working assistant scene.

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Event domain | A subsystem that owns a logical object family, event source family, or namespace. Examples: ReAct artifacts, memory, task issues, canvas. |
| Namespace | The prefix before `:` in a logical ref. Examples: `fi:`, `mem:`, `task:`, `cnv:`. |
| Namespace owner | The domain that mints refs in a namespace and defines their semantics. |
| Resolver | Backend callable owned by the namespace owner. It maps `object_ref + action` to a bounded result. |
| Event source reader | Backend callable owned by the namespace owner. It resolves a canonical ref for model reads such as `react.read(paths=["mem:..."])`. |
| Policy | ReAct rendering callable owned by the event domain. It maps events/tool results into blocks, timeline text, compaction text, or ANNOUNCE text. |
| Composition bundle | A bundle that imports available domains, registers their resolvers/policies/tools/widgets, and mounts the UI scene. |

## Core Rules

1. The namespace owner defines object semantics.
2. A composition bundle registers resolvers; it does not redefine them.
3. Canvas stores canonical refs and board metadata; it does not rehost or
   reinterpret non-canvas objects.
4. ReAct rendering uses event policies; it must not depend on UI card code.
5. `react.read` for owner-domain refs resolves through event source readers,
   then renders through the owner's event policies.
6. A ref keeps its original namespace when it moves between surfaces.
7. Current resolver registration is local Python import plus explicit
   registration. Remote resolver discovery is not implemented.

## Domain Ownership Table

| Domain | Canonical refs or event source | Owner module | Resolver location | Policy location | Default representation owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ReAct artifacts | `fi:<artifact-ref>` | ReAct event/artifact layer | `kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.react.events.resolver` | ReAct event policies | ReAct SDK |
| Memory | `mem:<memory-id>` | SDK memory module | `kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.context.memory.events.resolver` | memory event policies when present | Memory SDK |
| Task issue story | `task:issues/<issue-id>` | Task/issue subsystem | bundle task module, for example `issues/events/resolver.py` | task issue policies | Task subsystem |
| Canvas board | canvas events and canvas-owned refs | Canvas subsystem | canvas module, for example `canvas/events/resolver.py` | canvas event policies | Canvas subsystem |
| Knowledge source | `ks:<doc-or-source-ref>` | Knowledge subsystem | knowledge resolver module | knowledge/source policies | Knowledge subsystem |

The task-tracker bundle is currently a composition bundle. It imports the
domains above and registers them. It is not the owner of `fi:` or `mem:`.

## Resolver Contract

A resolver answers actions for one namespace.

```text
input:
  object_ref: canonical logical ref
  action: capabilities | describe | preview | open | download | rehost
  request context: tenant, project, user, story/conversation ids, storage handles

output:
  ok: boolean
  object_ref: same canonical ref
  namespace: namespace prefix
  resolver: stable resolver id
  capabilities: action availability map
  payload fields: resolver-specific bounded result
  ui_event: optional event request for mounted UI surfaces
```

Action meanings:

| Action | Meaning | Result shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capabilities` | Report supported actions for this ref. | `{preview, open, download, rehost}` booleans. |
| `describe` | Return resolver identity and compact metadata. | No large object body. |
| `preview` | Return bounded human/UI preview. | Title, summary, mime, compact object payload. |
| `open` | Request a UI surface to focus the object. | Usually returns `ui_event`. |
| `download` | Return bytes, signed URL, or stream metadata. | Transport owned by resolver. |
| `rehost` | Copy bytes/object into another owning subsystem. | New canonical ref in target namespace. |

The resolver must not return implementation-only UI handles as object
identity. For a ReAct artifact card, the identity remains `fi:...`; download
transport is returned only by the `fi:` resolver when `download` is called.

## Policy Contract

Resolvers handle object actions. Policies handle ReAct rendering.

ReAct policy phases:

| Phase | Purpose | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_call_validation` | Validate tool call batches before execution. | Accept/reject/annotate tool call. |
| `block_production` | Convert raw events or tool results into durable blocks. | Structured block rows. |
| `timeline_projection` | Render compact turn-visible timeline text. | Short facts, refs, status, revision. |
| `compaction_projection` | Render compact memory of old blocks. | Stable summaries. |
| `announce_production` | Render current high-priority context. | Board maps, focused refs, current story forms. |

Policy functions are registered with ReAct event policy decorators, for
example:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.react.events.policies import (
    announce_event_policy,
    timeline_projection_policy,
)

@timeline_projection_policy("task_tracker.timeline_projection.canvas_state")
def render_canvas_state_timeline(target, **context):
    ...

@announce_event_policy("task_tracker.announce.canvas_map")
def render_canvas_announce(target, **context):
    ...
```

The event source declaration chooses which policy ids apply to each event
source. A domain can ship default policy ids for its own events. A composition
bundle can override or add policy ids only when it intentionally changes the
agent-facing representation for that scene.

## Model Read Contract

Object resolvers are for UI or service actions: preview, open, download, and
rehost. Model reads use the event-source reader path.

```text
react.read(paths=["mem:mem_123"])
  -> namespace owner reader for mem:
  -> source id memory.read_memory
  -> memory block-production policy
  -> rendered block on the current timeline/read result
```

Owner module example:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import event_source_reader

@event_source_reader(
    namespace="mem",
    event_source_id="{alias}.read_memory",
    description="Read a durable memory by mem: ref.",
)
async def read_memory_event_ref(*, ref, ctx_browser=None, **context):
    ...
```

The reader returns the owner-domain payload. It should not pre-render timeline
text unless that text is part of the domain object. The source's
`block_production` policy renders the payload into model-visible blocks.

This is the same ownership rule as external event ingestion:

```text
external event occurrence
  -> event source declaration
  -> block-production policy
  -> timeline block

react.read(owner-ref)
  -> event source reader
  -> event source declaration
  -> block-production policy
  -> read block
```

The event source declaration's `kind` must match the occurrence family:

| `kind` | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `react.tool` | Actual model-callable tool source, for example `canvas.patch`. |
| `react.event_source_reader` | Read source behind `react.read` owner refs, for example `memory.read_memory` for `mem:` or `canvas.read` for `cnv:`. |
| `react.external` | Authored UI/integration event transported through `external_events[]`. |

`kind` is not tool visibility. Tool visibility still comes from the tool
subsystem. Reader sources are intentionally not called directly by the model.

Do not add namespace-specific branches to ReAct for every subsystem. Add an
owner reader and owner policies, then load that module into the composition
bundle's event source subsystem.

## Resolver And Policy Are Different

| Question | Resolver answers | Policy answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User clicked "open" on a `task:` card. | Which task object to open, and which UI event to emit. | Not involved. |
| Agent sees `[CANVAS BOARD]` in ANNOUNCE. | Not involved. | Canvas announce policy rendered the board. |
| Agent calls `react.read(paths=["mem:..."])`. | Not involved unless the owner reader itself delegates to an object resolver. | Memory block-production policy renders the resolved memory. |
| User drags a `fi:` file to canvas. | `fi:` resolver can later preview/download it. | ReAct artifact policies can render it in timeline/ANNOUNCE if included as event context. |
| Agent calls `task.patch`. | Task tool and task resolver own the task mutation result. | Task tool result policy renders compact timeline and refreshed ANNOUNCE. |
| Old turn is compacted. | Not involved. | Compaction policy renders durable summary. |

## Composition Bundle Topology

Current implementation uses local Python imports. The composition bundle is
the only place where these imports are assembled into one scene.

```text
composition bundle
  entrypoint.py
    imports resolver modules from mounted domains
    imports policy modules from mounted domains
    registers resolver instances/adapters
    exposes bundle operations and widgets

  tools_descriptor.py
    exposes tools from mounted domains

  agents/instructions.py
    concatenates stable additional instructions from mounted domains

  ui
    mounts chat, canvas, memory, task, and other widgets
```

Runtime resolver graph:

```text
canvas/card action or other object action request
  -> composition bundle operation
  -> resolver registry
  -> namespace_for_ref(object_ref)
  -> owner resolver
  -> bounded result or ui_event
```

Runtime ReAct context graph:

```text
browser/widget selected context
  -> external_events[]
  -> event source declaration
  -> block_production policies
  -> timeline_projection policies
  -> announce_production policies
  -> ReAct decision input
```

The composition bundle wires both graphs. The resolver graph is for object
actions. The ReAct context graph is for model-facing rendering.

## Current Local Registration Pattern

Example: task-tracker scene composition.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.context.memory.events.resolver import (
    memory_ref_capabilities,
    resolve_memory_ref_action,
)
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.react.events.resolver import (
    resolve_event_ref_action,
)

from .canvas.events.resolver import (
    CallableCanvasObjectResolver,
    build_default_canvas_resolver_registry,
)
from .issues.events.resolver import TaskIssueObjectResolver


def build_scene_resolver_registry(store, issue_service, memory_store, memory_scope):
    registry = build_default_canvas_resolver_registry(store)

    registry.register(TaskIssueObjectResolver(service_factory=issue_service))

    registry.register(CallableCanvasObjectResolver(
        namespace="fi",
        resolver="react.event_ref",
        resolver_status="implemented",
        capabilities={"preview": True, "open": False, "download": True, "rehost": False},
        handler=lambda payload, user_id, story_id, action: resolve_event_ref_action(...),
    ))

    registry.register(CallableCanvasObjectResolver(
        namespace="mem",
        resolver="sdk.memory",
        resolver_status="implemented",
        capabilities=memory_ref_capabilities(),
        handler=lambda payload, user_id, story_id, action: resolve_memory_ref_action(...),
    ))

    return registry
```

The adapter is allowed in the composition bundle. The semantic code stays in
the namespace owner module.

## Registration Checklist

For each domain mounted into a scene:

| Required item | Owner implements | Composition bundle does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical namespace | Yes | Preserves refs unchanged. |
| Resolver | Yes | Imports and registers it. |
| Event source reader | Yes, if `react.read` should resolve refs in this namespace | Imports the owner module through tool/event source specs. |
| ReAct event policies | Yes | Imports policy module and binds policy ids through event source descriptors. |
| Tools | Yes, if the domain is agent-editable | Exposes tool descriptors to the agent. |
| Additional instructions | Yes, if the agent needs stable operational rules | Concatenates instruction blocks. |
| UI widget | Yes, if domain has a surface | Mounts widget or keeps it available for open events. |
| Data Bus handlers | Yes, if domain owns durable state mutations | Registers handler during bundle load. |

## Mounted Widget Rule

An `open` resolver action can return a UI request:

```json
{
  "type": "kdcube.ui.object.open.requested",
  "subject": "ui.object.open.requested",
  "object_ref": "task:issues/ticket_2026-06-08-120000",
  "target_surface": "task_tracker.issue_editor",
  "mode": "focus"
}
```

The target widget owns dirty-state handling. The resolver requests the open; it
does not force the UI to discard edits.

For task editor navigation:

```text
open requested
  -> editor checks current draft
  -> clean: open requested issue
  -> dirty: show Save and open / Discard and open / Cancel
```

## Context Rendering Rule

If the user sends a chat message with context attached, the timeline for that
turn must include the context facts before the user prompt.

Correct order:

```text
[CANVAS STATE]
[CANVAS FOCUS]
[TASK STORY REF]
[MEMORY REF]
[USER MESSAGE]
```

Incorrect order:

```text
[USER MESSAGE]
```

The second form loses the execution context. It makes "this issue" or "this
card" ambiguous for ReAct.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Canvas stores `rn` or `ef` download handles as card identity. | Canvas stores only canonical refs such as `fi:...`, `task:...`, `mem:...`, `cnv:...`. |
| Composition bundle reimplements `mem:` preview. | Import memory resolver and register it. |
| Task resolver lives in `canvas/`. | Task resolver lives in task domain, for example `issues/events/resolver.py`. |
| ReAct `fi:` canonicalization lives in canvas. | ReAct owns `fi:` canonicalization in `react/events/resolver.py`. |
| Timeline policy dumps full JSON bodies. | Timeline policy renders compact facts and refs; ANNOUNCE carries current high-priority view. |
| Agent instructions contain mutable per-turn state. | Mutable state is rendered by event policies into timeline/ANNOUNCE. Instructions describe stable rules only. |
| Widget open silently replaces dirty editor state. | Target widget gates navigation and asks the user. |

## Related Resolver Directory Design

The current runtime uses local Python import plus explicit registration in the
composition bundle. The proposed cross-bundle design for a Redis TTL resolver
directory, direct resolver operation calls, temporary blob exchange, and Data
Bus handoff for async/UI cases is tracked in
[Resolver Directory And Operation Routing Design](design/resolver-directory-and-operation-routing-README.md).

## Implementation Status

Current implemented registration mode:

```text
local Python import -> explicit registration in composition bundle
```

Current non-implemented modes:

```text
remote resolver discovery
resolver marketplace
ad-hoc resolver request/reply topic
automatic resolver loading from arbitrary bundle metadata
```

Do not document a bundle as using remote resolver discovery unless that path is
implemented in platform code and covered by tests.

## Test Requirements

A composition bundle that mounts multiple event domains needs focused tests:

| Test | Assertion |
| --- | --- |
| Resolver path imports | All registered resolver modules import successfully. |
| Namespace dispatch | `task:`, `mem:`, `fi:`, `cnv:` route to the expected resolver id. |
| Canonical ref preservation | Dragging/pinning the same object from different surfaces produces the same `object_ref`. |
| Context event preservation | Live chat send and dry-run render the same context event batch before `[USER MESSAGE]`. |
| Policy rendering | Timeline is compact; ANNOUNCE contains current high-priority view. |
| UI open dirty state | Open request does not discard unsaved edits. |

These tests belong to the composition bundle because they verify that the
scene is wired correctly. Unit tests for resolver semantics belong to the
namespace owner.
