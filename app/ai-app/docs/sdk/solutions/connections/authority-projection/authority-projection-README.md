# Authority Projection

Authority projection is the step that turns a linked external identity into
runtime authority.

```text
actor identity
  telegram_100200300
        +
linked platform principal
  a1b2c3d4-...
        |
        v
UserSession + identity_authority
```

## Why It Exists

The actor and the authority source can be different.

```text
actor/storage identity:
  telegram_100200300

platform authority identity:
  a1b2c3d4-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d
```

This lets an app keep Telegram-scoped storage or product behavior while platform
role checks and economics use the linked platform principal.

## Runtime Shape

```text
UserSession
  user_id     = telegram_100200300
  roles       = ["kdcube:role:super-admin"]
  permissions = [...]
  budget_bypass = true
  identity_authority
        |
        v
identity_authority
  actor_user_id       = telegram_100200300
  storage_user_id     = telegram_100200300
  platform_user_id    = a1b2c3d4-...
  economics_user_id   = a1b2c3d4-...
  platform_roles      = ["kdcube:role:super-admin"]
  platform_permissions = [...]
  budget_bypass       = true
  identity_provider   = telegram
  identity_provider_subject = 100200300
```

After projection, downstream code should see a normal authorized session. It
should not re-check Telegram or parse provider proof.

`user_type` is not authority. It is a legacy compatibility label that older
accounting/runtime APIs may derive from explicit facts:

```text
roles / permissions / budget_bypass / anonymous state
  -> legacy accounting/runtime lane when an old API still asks for one
```

New Connection Hub projections should carry explicit facts, not a precomputed
`user_type`.

## Role Rule

Provider-local roles are not platform roles.

```text
Telegram local role = admin
  -> can authorize Telegram app/admin behavior
  -> must not become kdcube:role:admin

Platform principal roles
  -> kdcube:role:super-admin
  -> kdcube:role:admin
  -> kdcube:role:paid
  -> used for platform requirements and economics
```

## Runtime Boundaries

Projected authority must cross detached work boundaries:

```text
request
  -> queue/schedule job
  -> later worker
  -> ReAct/runtime/tools/economics
```

For scheduled automations, the job source should carry normalized
`identity_authority` so the later run can restore the same effective authority.
Do not make each surface redo provider-specific auth or role mapping.

## Federated Data Bus Sessions

Non-browser clients use the same projection model. For example, a Telegram Mini
App calls Connection Hub `federated_data_bus_claim` with Telegram proof
headers. Connection Hub creates a Data Bus `UserSession` whose actor remains the
Telegram user:

```text
user_id = telegram_100200300
```

If no connection edge exists, the session stays low authority:

```text
roles       = []
permissions = []
budget_bypass = false
```

If `telegram:100200300` has an edge to a platform user, the next claim keeps
the same actor id and projects the platform authority into that session. The
federated token itself only points at the session; it does not duplicate roles,
permissions, or provider identity in the signed token body.

## Managed MCP Delegated Client Projection

For managed MCP, the external client is the actor and the consenting platform
user is the grantor/economics subject:

```text
delegate actor:
  authority_id = delegated_client
  user_id      = integration:claude:02e...

grantor / economics subject:
  authority_id = platform
  user_id      = 02e...

request projection:
  runtime user id used by product reads = grantor subject when identity_scope=grantor
  provenance/delegate metadata          = integration:claude:02e...
  selected grants/tools                 = delegated credential grant record
```

This is how `kdcube-services@1-0/public/mcp/named_services` can call memory
named-service search as the approving platform user while still logging that the
call came from Claude. The projection is created by the managed MCP guard before
the bundle MCP handler runs.

## SDK Helpers

The platform SDK exposes helpers for normalizing/applying this envelope:

```text
kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.identity_authority
```

Main responsibilities:

- resolve platform authority for a linked platform user;
- normalize authority before storing it in a queued job/source;
- apply authority to the communication/request context before role checks,
  economics, ReAct, tools, or child runtimes run.
