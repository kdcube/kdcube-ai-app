# Connection Hub Storage Model

Connection Hub uses multiple storage surfaces. They are separate on purpose.

```text
descriptors / bundles.yaml
  non-secret deployment config

bundles.secrets.yaml / secrets service
  verifier secrets and OAuth client secrets

Postgres
  request-authenticator metadata

bundle-local state today
  connection edges
  connection-edge challenges
  delegated account connection state

Redis/cache
  discovery, event delivery, runtime caches
```

## Matrix

| Object | Current storage | Contains secrets? | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Provider/app config | `bundles.yaml` app props | no | Authority ids, authenticator ids, OAuth app definitions, descriptor authenticators. |
| Authority registry metadata | `connection-hub@1-0.config.authority_registry` | no | Authority ids, `platform: true`, provider instances, provider types, entrypoints, allowed grants, TTL metadata. |
| Bot token / OAuth client secret | `bundles.secrets.yaml` or secrets service | yes | Read through bundle secret lifecycle using `secret_ref`. |
| Request-authenticator metadata | Postgres | no | Stores provider, authority id, authenticator id, `secret_ref`, verifier metadata. |
| Connection edge | bundle-local JSON today | no | Delegates one authority identity to another authority identity. |
| Identity family | derived from connection edges | no | Resolver output for product aggregation; not persisted separately. |
| Connection-edge challenge | bundle-local JSON today | no | Short-lived proof state for writing an edge. |
| Delegated account token | connections/email stores | yes, user token | OAuth token or app password for automation. |
| Live link update | Data Bus / event delivery | no | Signals original iframe after browser claim completes. |

## Request-Authenticator Metadata

Request-authenticator metadata belongs in Postgres because it is admin/widget
managed operational metadata:

```text
connection_hub_request_authenticators
  authenticator_id
  authority_id
  provider
  enabled
  role_providing
  subject_namespace
  secret_ref
  selector
  verifier
  properties
```

Secret values must not be stored here. Only `secret_ref` is stored.

## Authority Registry Metadata

Authority registry metadata is descriptor-backed. It is configuration, not
proof and not a secret store:

```yaml
connection-hub@1-0:
  config:
    authority_registry:
      authorities:
        kdcube.platform:
          platform: true
          grants:
            subjects:
              google:<verified_sub>:
                roles: [kdcube:role:super-admin]
                permissions: [kdcube:*:*:*]
            bootstrap_rules:
              - id: bootstrap_admin_by_google_email
                when:
                  provider: google
                  claims:
                    email: owner@example.com
                    email_verified: true
                roles: [kdcube:role:super-admin]
                permissions: [kdcube:*:*:*]
          providers:
            versatile_google_session:
              type: bundle_session_login
              entrypoints:
                login:
                  bundle_id: versatile@2026-03-31-13-36
                  route: public
                  operation: platform_login
                session_issue:
                  bundle_id: versatile@2026-03-31-13-36
                  route: public
                  operation: auth_google_session
                consent:
                  bundle_id: versatile@2026-03-31-13-36
                  route: public
                  operation: delegated_consent
              input:
                authenticator_ref:
                  authority_id: google.accounts
                  provider_id: google_oidc
              issuer:
                type: kdcube_session_token
                ttl_seconds: 43200
              grants:
                default:
                  roles: [kdcube:role:registered]
                  permissions: []
                assignable:
                  roles: [kdcube:role:registered, kdcube:role:super-admin]
                  permissions: [kdcube:*:chat:*;read;write, kdcube:*:*:*]
        google.accounts:
          platform: false
          providers:
            google_oidc:
              type: google_id_token
              authenticator:
                client_id: 960111679915-825b0cenujpavcmognp450l7ius4suje.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

The provider instance may reference a bundle-hosted operation, but roles,
permissions, TTL, authority id, and `platform` flag belong to Connection Hub.
The hosting bundle does not keep a separate platform-session policy branch; it
is resolved by `host.bundle_id`, `host.route`, and `host.operation`.

Verifier secrets still stay outside this registry and are reached by
`secret_ref` through the secrets lifecycle.

Descriptor-backed authority grants are a bootstrap/demo policy for
bundle-session platform subjects. They do not make a raw Telegram or Google
proof a platform user by themselves; they are applied only inside a registered
platform login provider flow that issues a platform session.

The canonical assignment key is the stable authority subject, for example
`google:<verified_sub>`. `grants.bootstrap_rules` may help bootstrap an
assignment from verified upstream claims, such as `email + email_verified`, but
email is not stored as the identity key.

The runtime that applies this descriptor shape lives in the Connection Hub SDK:

```text
kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.connections.authority_providers.bundle_session_login
```

## Delegated Credential Grant State Today

The current delegated-client OAuth adapter stores short-lived OAuth and access
grant records through `GrantStore`:

```text
code / csrf / access grant:
  Redis, short TTL, fail closed when missing

refresh token / dynamic client registration:
  currently Redis in the demo implementation
  target production storage is durable
```

The server-side grant records carry enforcement state:

```text
resource
selected tools
selected grants
identity_scope
grantor authority facts
delegation edges
nested named-service namespace catalog
```

MCP connector presentation metadata is not persisted as authority state. Server
icons, `website_url`, server instructions, and `ToolAnnotations` are advertised
by the MCP server on `initialize` / `tools/list`.

## Connection Edges Today

The current example implementation stores connection edges in bundle-local JSON:

```text
<bundle_storage_root>/connections/connection-edges.json
<bundle_storage_root>/connections/connection-edge-challenges.json
```

This is why Telegram/platform edges do not appear in Postgres yet.

For the local demo runtime, the path is:

```text
~/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/<tenant>__<project>/data/bundle-storage/<tenant>/<project>/connection-hub-1-0/connections/
```

## Target Storage

For production shape, connection edges and challenges should move to a durable
database or platform identity service:

```text
connection_hub_edges
  edge_id
  relationship
  from_authority_id
  from_provider
  from_subject
  from_user_id
  to_authority_id
  to_provider
  to_subject
  to_user_id
  grants
  constraints
  proof
  status
  metadata

connection_hub_edge_challenges
  challenge_id
  provider
  provider_subject
  target_authority_id
  target_user_id
  grants
  live_event_session_id
  status
  expires_at
  metadata
```

The API and logical flow should not change when storage moves.

## Secret Boundary

Verifier secrets stay in descriptor-backed bundle secrets or the configured
secrets service:

```yaml
secrets:
  identity:
    authenticators:
      telegram_kdcube_ref:
        bot_token: "..."
```

Metadata rows reference secrets:

```yaml
secret_ref: identity.authenticators.telegram_kdcube_ref.bot_token
```

No widget/admin API should accept raw fields such as `bot_token`,
`client_secret`, `signing_secret`, `api_key`, or `secret_value`.
