# Delegated Accounts

Delegated accounts answer a different question than identity links:

```text
Can an app or automation act on this user's external account?
```

Examples:

```text
platform user 02e...
  -> Gmail OAuth token
  -> Slack OAuth token
  -> iCloud app-specific password
```

## Boundary

Delegated account connections are capabilities. They are not identity proof and
they are not platform roles.

```text
Identity link:
  telegram:434804821 -> platform_user_id

Delegated account:
  platform_user_id -> Gmail OAuth token
```

An app may use a delegated token only after normal platform/request authority is
established for the current execution.

## Three-Level Model

```text
provider
  OAuth mechanics, no credentials
      |
      v
client app
  app_id, client_id, scope ceiling, client_secret in secrets
      |
      v
user account
  account id, access/refresh token, connected through one app_id
```

Multiple client apps can exist for one provider.

```text
google
  -> app_id=gmail.personal
  -> app_id=gmail.enterprise

slack
  -> app_id=slack.workspace_a
  -> app_id=slack.workspace_b
```

## Current Providers

```text
Gmail
  generic connections framework
  OAuth through shared Connection Hub callback

Slack
  generic connections framework
  OAuth through shared Connection Hub callback

iCloud
  email integration
  app-specific password, no OAuth
```

Gmail should not be documented as an `email_*` app-password integration. Gmail
rides the generic delegated account framework.

## Runtime Use

```text
app/agent has authorized execution context
       |
       v
ConnectionsClient / named-service provider
       |
       v
Connection Hub resolves user's delegated account
       |
       v
provider token/capability returned to app-side integration code
```

The app should not ask delegated accounts for platform roles. Roles come from
platform authority projection.
