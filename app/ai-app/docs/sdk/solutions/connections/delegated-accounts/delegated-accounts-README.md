# Delegated Provider Accounts

Delegated provider accounts are a subtype of
[Delegated Connections](../delegated-connections/delegated-connections-README.md).
They answer this question:

```text
Can an app or automation act on this user's external account?
```

Examples:

```text
platform user 02e...
  -> Gmail OAuth token
  -> Slack OAuth token
  -> iCloud app-specific password
```

In delegated-connection terms:

```text
grantor principal
  platform user 02e...
      |
      v
delegated representative
  KDCube automation/app using provider account
      |
      v
credential plus approved claims
  Gmail OAuth token / Slack OAuth token / iCloud app password
      |
      v
resource surface
  Gmail / Slack / iCloud
```

## Boundary

Delegated provider account connections are provider credentials plus approved
claims. They are not identity proof and they are not platform roles.

```text
Identity link:
  telegram:100200300 -> platform_user_id

Delegated account:
  platform_user_id -> Gmail OAuth token

Delegated external client:
  Claude/KDCube-issued delegated_client token -> KDCube MCP resource
```

An app may use a delegated token only after normal platform/request authority is
established for the current execution.

Delegated accounts are outbound claims: KDCube uses a provider account on
behalf of the user. Managed delegated-client credentials are inbound
delegations: an external client calls a KDCube resource with a KDCube-issued
credential. Both are Connection Hub delegations, but they store and enforce
different token directions.

## Three-Level Model

```text
provider
  OAuth mechanics, no credentials
      |
      v
connector app
  connector_app_id, client_id, allowed_claims ceiling, client_secret in secrets
      |
      v
user account
  account id, access/refresh token, connected through one connector_app_id,
  approved claims for that external account/workspace
```

Multiple connector apps can exist for one provider.

```text
google
  -> connector_app_id=gmail.personal
  -> connector_app_id=gmail.enterprise

slack
  -> connector_app_id=slack.workspace_a
  -> connector_app_id=slack.workspace_b
```

## Current Providers

```text
Gmail
  generic connections framework
  OAuth through shared Connection Hub callback

Slack
  generic connections framework
  OAuth through shared Connection Hub callback

iCloud
  email integration
  app-specific password, no OAuth
```

Gmail should not be documented as an `email_*` app-password integration. Gmail
rides the generic delegated account framework.

## Runtime Use

```text
app/agent has authorized execution context
       |
       v
ConnectionsClient / named-service provider
       |
       v
Connection Hub resolves user's delegated account
       |
       v
provider credential handle returned to app-side integration code
```

The app should not ask delegated provider accounts for platform roles. Roles
come from platform authority projection.

## Credential Health

Provider credentials stay in user secrets. Public account records expose only
metadata and health fields:

```text
credential_status        active | expires_soon | refreshable |
                         reconnect_required | missing | revoked
credential_kind          oauth | static_secret | missing
credential_expires_at
credential_refreshable
reconnect_required
credential_message
credential_status_at     when the persisted status last changed
last_error               most recent provider symptom, verbatim
last_error_at
```

Two health signals combine on account listings:

- **timestamp-derived** — computed from the stored credential's expiry and
  refreshability on every listing;
- **persisted** — written on health transitions (`store.set_account_status`)
  by the broker and the tool-side facade, together with `last_error`.

A persisted `reconnect_required` / `missing` / `revoked` outranks the
timestamp view: a provider may reject a token whose stored expiry still looks
valid, and Connection Hub must show that truth. A later successful refresh
writes the persisted status back to `active`.

OAuth access tokens are short-lived. If a stored credential has a refresh
token, the delegated-account broker refreshes the access token before
returning a credential handle to application code and writes the refreshed
token back to user secrets.

## Resolution Reasons

`broker.ensure_claim()` returns a `ClaimResolution` whose `error` names WHY
the claim did not resolve. The reason flows verbatim through the consent
payload into tool envelopes, named-service errors, and MCP results:

| reason | meaning | user action | retry_hint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `connect_required` | no eligible connected account | connect the provider | true |
| `claim_upgrade_required` | account exists, claim not approved | approve the claim | true |
| `reconnect_required` | credential missing / unrefreshable / provider rejected it | reconnect the account | true |
| `account_required` | several eligible accounts | pick an `account_id` and resend | true |
| `claim_not_configured`, `connector_app_not_configured`, `claim_outside_connector_app` | operator configuration errors | admin action | false |

`retry_hint` says whether retrying the same operation after the user
completes the Connection Hub action should succeed.

## Multiple Accounts

A user can connect several accounts of one provider (two Slack workspaces,
two Gmail addresses). Resolution never picks one silently: with no
`account_id` and several eligible accounts it returns `account_required`
with **labeled candidates**:

```text
candidates: [{account_id, label, email, workspace, status, claims}]
```

Chat, named services, and MCP clients render this as a real choice list and
resend with the chosen `account_id`. Every provider tool accepts an optional
`account_id` parameter, and successful results carry the `account_id` they
used so multi-account output stays attributable.

## Consent Payload And Hub Deep-Link

Failed resolutions become one consent block
(`connected_account_consent_payload`, envelope code
`needs_connected_account_consent`). The block names ONE provider action:

```text
consent:
  reason           the resolution reason, verbatim
  retry_hint
  provider_id / connector_app_id
  claims           scoped to the named provider only
  account_id       when the failure targets an existing account
  candidates       labeled, for account_required
  url              Connection Hub widget deep-link
  action_label     Connect account / Approve access / Reconnect account /
                   Choose account
```

The `url` carries `tab=delegated_to_kdcube`, `provider_id`,
`connector_app_id`, `claims`, and `account_id` query parameters. The
Connection Hub widget turns them into a consent plan: a step list (account
connected → access working → requested approvals as per-claim chips) with a
single primary button for the first unmet step, and highlights the affected
account card. Failures of other providers stay in the payload's raw
`missing` list and surface on the next turn.

## Live Provider Rejection (Refresh-Retry-Once)

A provider can reject a token mid-call even when stored timestamps look
valid. Tool code follows one contract, packaged by
`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.connected_accounts`:

```text
run_with_connected_account_retry(source, where=..., run=tool_body)

tool body:
  resolves its own credentials (resolve_connected_account_claim)
  on provider auth rejection returns
    connected_account_auth_failure(credential, provider_error)

runner:
  1. run once
  2. on the failure marker: force-refresh THAT credential
     (refresh_connected_account_claim -> broker force_refresh=True;
     the refreshed token lands in user secrets)
  3. re-run once (the body re-resolves and picks up the fresh token)
  4. second rejection: provider_auth_failed() marks the account
     reconnect_required (+ last_error) and returns the reconnect envelope
```

The marker carries the failing credential, so tools that use several
credentials in one operation (for example Gmail forward = read + send)
refresh exactly the one the provider rejected. The Gmail and Slack tool
suites run entirely under this runner; auth-class provider errors
(HTTP 401/403, Slack `invalid_auth`/`token_revoked`/…) never reach users as
raw API errors.
