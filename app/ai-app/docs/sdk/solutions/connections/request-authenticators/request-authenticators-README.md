# Request Authenticators

Request authenticators verify proof carried by incoming requests. The
authenticator selector selects authenticators, not authorities. Each
authenticator is registered under an `authority_id`.

```text
Telegram initData
Slack signature
webhook HMAC
API key
OIDC claim
        |
        v
Connection Hub authenticator module
        |
        v
verified identity + authority_id
```

The gateway does not parse Telegram, Slack, API-key, or webhook proof itself.
It passes a request envelope to Connection Hub and receives an authenticated
result when one authenticator module accepts it.

## Selector Shape

```text
raw request
   |
   v
Connection Hub SDK RequestAuthResolver
   |
   +-- platform token/cookie/session authenticator
   |
   +-- ConnectionHubAuthenticationSurface
         |
         v
       request_authenticate(RequestEnvelope)
         |
         v
       authenticator verifies proof
         |
         v
       verified identity + authority_id
         |
         v
       linker/grant resolver if the surface requires another authority
         |
         v
       AuthenticatedRequest
   |
   v
UserSession
```

Service-level resolver behavior is documented in
[Auth Selector](../../../../service/auth/auth-selector-README.md). This document
describes the Connection Hub side of that authentication surface.

## Request Envelope

The SDK contract passes a JSON-safe view of the request:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/api/...",
  "url": "https://...",
  "headers": {
    "x-telegram-init-data": "...",
    "x-kdcube-auth-authority-id": "telegram.kdcube_ref",
    "x-kdcube-auth-authenticator-id": "telegram.kdcube_ref.init_data"
  },
  "query": {},
  "cookies": {}
}
```

Controlled KDCube surfaces should include:

```http
X-KDCube-Auth-Authority-ID: telegram.kdcube_ref
X-KDCube-Auth-Authenticator-ID: telegram.kdcube_ref.init_data
```

For third-party callbacks that cannot send custom headers, put the
integration id in the callback URL:

```text
/public/telegram_webhook?integration_id=telegram.kdcube_ref
```

## Hints

`authority_id`, `authenticator_id`, and provider-specific integration ids are
non-secret selector hints. They
narrow which authenticators may be tried. They are not trusted facts. They are
the request-side selector contract for KDCube-controlled surfaces.

```text
authenticator_id = telegram.kdcube_ref.init_data
  -> Connection Hub authenticator row
  -> authority_id=telegram.kdcube_ref
  -> secret_ref=identity.authenticators.telegram_kdcube_ref.bot_token
```

For Telegram webhooks, the SDK accepts the bundle-level `integration_id`
selector because webhook routes are configured from bundle integration rows:

```text
integration_id = telegram.kdcube_ref
  -> bundle integration row
  -> bot token / webhook secret secret refs
  -> Telegram webhook verifier
```

These hints are not:

- a bot token;
- a Telegram bot id;
- a platform user id;
- a connection edge.

If an explicit authenticator id is present, Connection Hub should try that row
only and fail closed if it is missing, disabled, or rejects the proof.

## Authenticator Modules

Authenticator modules live inside Connection Hub because they need
access to:

- Connection Hub authenticator metadata;
- bundle secret references;
- connection-edge resolution;
- provider-specific verifier code.

```text
Connection Hub
  authenticator modules:
    telegram.init_data
    telegram.webhook
    slack.signature
    oidc.claim
    delegated_client.bearer
    api-key
    webhook-hmac
```

Apps and gateway code should not duplicate this verifier logic.

`delegated_client.bearer` is the current authenticator used by managed MCP
surfaces. It verifies a KDCube-issued delegated credential and its server-side
grant record. It does not verify Telegram, Slack, webhook, or OIDC provider
proofs. Those stay in provider-specific modules.

```text
Authorization: Bearer <kst1 delegated credential>
  -> delegated_client.bearer authenticator
  -> grant record lookup
  -> resource/tool/grant/identity-scope enforcement
```

For `kdcube-services@1-0/public/mcp/named_services`, this authenticator proves
the external client credential. The named-service bridge then applies the nested
namespace catalog for calls such as `named_services_search(namespace="mem")`.

## Output

A successful Connection Hub authentication surface returns authority material:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "authenticated": true,
  "authority_id": "telegram.kdcube_ref",
  "identity_subject": "100200300",
  "provider": "telegram",
  "provider_subject": "100200300",
  "selected_authenticator": "telegram.kdcube_ref.init_data",
  "actor_user_id": "telegram_100200300",
  "platform_user_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "identity_authority": {
    "actor_user_id": "telegram_100200300",
    "platform_user_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "economics_user_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "platform_roles": ["kdcube:role:super-admin"],
    "budget_bypass": true
  }
}
```

The gateway turns this into a normal `UserSession`.
