# Connection Hub Solution

Connection Hub is the solution component that lets KDCube connect identities,
request proofs, platform authority, and delegated connections without
collapsing those concepts into scattered auth tricks.

It has eight roles:

```text
Connection Hub
  |
  +-- Connection Edges
  |     identity -> identity delegation, same graph for links and delegates
  |
  +-- Identity Family Resolver
  |     current actor/platform user -> runtime user ids from connection edges
  |
  +-- Request Authenticators
  |     request proof -> verified external identity
  |
  +-- Authority Providers
  |     authority_id -> authenticators + grant resolver + linkers
  |
  +-- Authority Projection
  |     actor identity + resolved connection edge -> UserSession authority
  |     short-lived Data Bus tokens use that UserSession
  |
  +-- Delegated Connections
  |     credential/proof -> authenticator -> linker/grant -> allowed actions
  |
  +-- Link Flows
  |     platform-first and channel-first linking
  |
  +-- Widget/Auth Context Transport
        host iframe/server config -> promoted auth headers
```

## One Mental Model

```text
incoming world event/request/widget call
       |
       | proof material
       |   browser cookies / Telegram initData / Slack signature / API key
       v
Connection Hub Authenticator Selector
       |
       | candidate authenticators
       v
Request Authenticator
       |
       | verified identity + authority_id
       v
Surface Guard
       |
       | same authority -> Grant Resolver
       | different authority -> Connection Edge Resolver -> Grant Resolver
       v
KDCube app/API/runtime/ReAct/economics
```

Delegated connections are the common abstraction for consented capability
relationships. The token or proof is not meaningful by itself. A registered
authenticator interprets it, and a linker/grant resolver decides which
principal, representative, resource, and actions it carries:

```text
credential / proof / token
  Telegram initData / Gmail OAuth token / iCloud password / KDCube OAuth token
       |
       v
registered authenticator
  telegram / gmail / slack / icloud / delegated_client / future provider
       |
       v
linker / grant resolver
  connection edge / delegated account grant / delegated client grant
       |
       v
allowed actions on resource surface
  Gmail / Slack / iCloud / KDCube MCP / future KDCube API
```

The visible use cases differ only by authenticator and linker:

```text
Telegram:
  initData -> telegram authenticator -> connection edge -> projected UserSession

Gmail:
  OAuth account credential -> google authenticator -> account grant -> Gmail capability

OAuth delegated credential:
  KDCube-issued token -> delegated_client authenticator -> grant registry -> integration principal + tools
```

Connection edges prove which identity may represent which other identity, and
which grants are delegated on that relationship. Delegated connection
credentials are one edge-producing/edge-consuming use case; Telegram account
linking is another. Do not derive platform roles from provider-local roles. The
delegated representative receives only the allowed capability, not the
grantor's full platform session.

## Main Roundtrips

### Channel-First Connection Edge Flow

The user starts in a context where provider auth material is already present.
Telegram Mini App is the current implemented example.

```text
Telegram Mini App has Telegram.WebApp.initData
       |
       v
host embeds Connection Hub iframe
       |
       | CONFIG_RESPONSE.authContext.headers
       |   X-Telegram-Init-Data
       |   X-KDCube-Auth-Authority-ID
       |   X-KDCube-Auth-Authenticator-ID
       v
Connection Hub iframe calls Connection Hub
       |
       v
Connection Hub authenticator selector picks the Telegram verifier
       |
       v
Connection Hub validates Telegram proof
       |
       v
creates provider-proof claim challenge
       |
       v
user opens platform claim URL in browser
       |
       v
KDCube platform sign-in if needed
       |
       v
claim endpoint writes telegram:<id> -> platform_user_id connection edge
       |
       v
Connection Hub emits Data Bus update to original iframe
```

### Platform-First Connection Edge Flow

The user starts from a normal KDCube browser/platform session.

```text
KDCube browser session
       |
       v
Connection Hub creates challenge for current platform_user_id
       |
       v
user opens provider proof surface
       |
       v
provider proof completes challenge
       |
       v
Connection Hub writes provider:<subject> -> platform_user_id
```

### Request Authentication

The gateway/service auth side asks for a complete `UserSession`.

```text
HTTP / SSE / Socket.IO / app API request
       |
       v
Connection Hub SDK RequestAuthResolver
       |
       +-- platform token/cookie auth
       |
       +-- ConnectionHubAuthenticationSurface
             |
             v
           selected authenticator verifies request proof
             |
             v
           verified identity + authority_id
             |
             v
           connection edge resolver resolves required authority if needed
             |
             v
           grant resolver returns roles/economics/access grants
       |
       v
UserSession
```

## Data Sources

| Data | Source | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider proof | Incoming request or host widget config, for example Telegram `initData` | Request authenticator module |
| Authority/authenticator hints | App/server config for the surface that owns the provider integration | Connection Hub authenticator selector |
| Verifier secret | Bundle secrets / secrets service via `secret_ref` | Provider verifier only |
| Connection edge | Connection Hub edge store | Request auth, authority projection, link status, delegation |
| Identity family | Connection Hub edge resolver | Product aggregation such as memories across connected identities |
| Platform roles | Platform principal/role resolver | Authority projection |
| Delegated connection grant | Connection Hub grant/account store | Automation/app tools or inbound protocol adapters |
| Provider account token | Connections framework user-scoped store | Automation/app tools |
| Widget auth context | Host `CONFIG_RESPONSE` | Child iframe API calls |

## Current Implementation Boundary

Current implementation:

- Telegram provider proof is implemented.
- Request-authenticator metadata is Postgres-backed.
- Connection edges and edge challenges are currently bundle-local JSON in the
  example app.
- Identity-family resolution is implemented as Connection Hub resolver logic
  over the same edge store.
- Delegated Gmail/Slack/iCloud provider account storage uses the existing
  connections and email integration stores.
- OAuth delegated credential is the current inbound delegated-connection
  protocol adapter.
- Gateway auth selection is documented in service auth.

Production direction:

- move connection edges and challenges to durable Postgres or a platform-owned
  identity service;
- keep verifier secrets only in descriptor-backed bundle secrets/secrets
  service;
- keep Connection Hub authenticators as the only place for Telegram/Slack/OIDC
  request-proof verification.

## Boundary With Delegated Credential Protocol Adapters

OAuth delegated credential is the current service/protocol implementation of one
delegated-connection authenticator and grant registry. It verifies KDCube-issued
integration credentials, resolves the delegated representative, and enforces
selected actions. The shared diagram lives in
[Delegated Credential Protocol Adapters](delegated-credentials/delegated-credential-protocol-adapters-README.md).

Do not put Telegram/Slack/webhook proof verification into OAuth delegated
credential. That belongs to Connection Hub request authenticators. Do not put
OAuth-code issuance, refresh-token rotation, or selected-tool grant state into
the generic edge store. That belongs to delegated connection protocol adapters
such as [OAuth delegated credential Protocol Adapter](delegated-credentials/oauth-delegated-credential-protocol-adapter-README.md).
