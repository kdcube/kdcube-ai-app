## Start Here

Primary reference bundle:

`src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/versatile@2026-03-31-13-36`

Read in this order:

1. this guide
2. [build/how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md](build/how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md)
3. the versatile reference doc
4. `entrypoint.py`
5. `orchestrator/workflow.py`
6. `tools_descriptor.py`
7. `skills_descriptor.py`
8. [bundle-agent-integration-README.md](bundle-agent-integration-README.md) when the bundle has React tools/skills, MCP, or Claude Code subagents

The assembly map is the fastest way to find reusable Tasks, Email, Telegram,
Delivery, web/rendering/exec tools, storage, widgets, jobs, MCP, and Claude
Code blocks before writing a bundle-local service.

Critical Python import rule:

- bundle-local code must use package-relative imports such as
  `from .services.storage import ...`
- do not import bundle-local folders as top-level packages such as `services`,
  `apps`, `tools`, or `resources`
- see [bundle-runtime-README.md#critical-bundle-local-import-rule](bundle-runtime-README.md#critical-bundle-local-import-rule)

If a bundle tool produces user-visible files, read
[bundle-agent-integration-README.md](bundle-agent-integration-README.md) and
[../tools/custom-tools-README.md](../tools/custom-tools-README.md). The bundle
tool should either return `ret.artifact_type: "files"` with `ret.files[]`, or
host the files from trusted tool code through `bundle_tool_context.host_files(...)`.
That helper is available in normal tool execution and in isolated
supervisor/runtime tool execution after the SDK has prepared the tool context
with hosting service, tenant/project/user/conversation/turn scope, conversation
storage, and output directory.

## Common Recipe: Choose A Model For One Agent Call

Use this when an API, widget, chat request, or job lets the caller choose a
temporary agent strength such as `lite`, `regular`, or `strong`.

```text
bundle code default
  -> config.role_models
deployment/admin override
  -> bundles.yaml items[].config.role_models
one invocation only
  -> bundle_call_context.role_models
```

The model router resolves the current call in that order:

1. `bundle_call_context.role_models`
2. effective bundle props `config.role_models`
3. platform defaults

The one-call override is visible to nested SDK agents, React, in-process tools,
and isolated Docker/Fargate tool runtimes while the context is bound. It is not
saved to bundle props; re-apply it for later jobs or requests from the job
payload or durable state.

Bundle-level default in code:

```python
class MyEntrypoint(BaseEntrypoint):
    @property
    def configuration(self):
        config = dict(super().configuration)
        role_models = dict(config.get("role_models") or {})
        role_models.setdefault(
            "report.writer",
            {"provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"},
        )
        config["role_models"] = role_models
        return config
```

External deployment override:

```yaml
items:
  - id: my.bundle@1-0
    config:
      role_models:
        report.writer:
          provider: anthropic
          model: claude-sonnet-4-6
        solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular:
          provider: anthropic
          model: claude-haiku-4-5
```

Ad hoc override in `@api`, `@mcp`, `@cron`, `@on_message`, or `@on_job` code:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import (
    bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch,
    get_current_bundle_call_context,
)

def role_context(role: str, model: str):
    current = get_current_bundle_call_context()
    role_models = dict(current.get("role_models") or {})
    role_models[role] = {"provider": "anthropic", "model": model}
    return {"role_models": role_models}

with bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch(
    role_context("report.writer", "claude-haiku-4-5")
):
    await self.run_my_agent_or_react(...)
```

When the selection comes from ingress rather than bundle code, put the same JSON
object into `ChatTaskPayload.bundle_call_context` before enqueueing the task.
The processor binds that payload field into runtime context before bundle code
runs. See [bundle-agent-integration-README.md](bundle-agent-integration-README.md#model-selection-for-agent-roles)
and [bundle-runtime-README.md](bundle-runtime-README.md#request-scoped-role-model-override).

## Environment Boundary

For bundle authors, `tenant/project` means one isolated environment.

Use a separate `tenant/project` when you need:

- tenant isolation
- a separate lifecycle stage such as `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`

Keep multiple bundles inside the same `tenant/project` when they belong to the
same environment.

So the platform model is:

- one environment = one `tenant/project`
- one environment can host many bundles
- one bundle = one end-to-end application unit inside that environment

## Minimal Bundle Shape

Recommended layout:

```text
my_bundle/
  entrypoint.py
  orchestrator/
    workflow.py
  tools_descriptor.py
  skills_descriptor.py
  tools/
  skills/
  ui/
    main/             # optional main UI app source
    widgets/          # optional widget app source
  tests/              # optional bundle-local tests
```

Required in practice:

- `entrypoint.py`
- bundle entrypoint registration
- a compiled graph or equivalent run path

Usually present in real bundles:

- `orchestrator/workflow.py`
- `tools_descriptor.py`
- `skills_descriptor.py`

Skills are discovered from more than the bundle folder. The active registry
loads core SDK skills, SDK solution skills, and then bundle-local
`CUSTOM_SKILLS_ROOT`. Use `skills_descriptor.py` `AGENTS_CONFIG` to narrow the
catalog for exact consumer ids such as `solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong` and
`solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular`. Skills that declare required tools are
also filtered against the active tool catalog, so solution skills disappear
automatically when their tools are not exposed. Use `AGENTS_CONFIG` when policy
needs an explicit allow-list or hard deny.

For skills that should exist only when their tools are available, add
`required: true` to those tool entries in the skill's `tools.yaml`. ReAct checks
these requirements against the active tool catalog, so the skill disappears
from catalog/import/read paths when the corresponding tools are not exposed.

Use `agent_disclosure: hidden` in a skill front matter only when the skill is
operational guidance that may be loaded by exact id/import but must not be
listed by the agent. It is not an authorization boundary; use `AGENTS_CONFIG`
to make a skill unavailable.

## Minimal Entry Pattern

```python
from langgraph.graph import END, START, StateGraph

from kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.agentic_loader import agentic_workflow, bundle_id
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.chatbot.entrypoint import BaseEntrypoint
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.service_hub.inventory import BundleState


@agentic_workflow(name="my.bundle", version="1.0.0")
@bundle_id("my.bundle@1.0.0")
class MyEntrypoint(BaseEntrypoint):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.graph = self._build_graph()

    def _build_graph(self):
        g = StateGraph(BundleState)
        g.add_node("orchestrate", self._orchestrate)
        g.add_edge(START, "orchestrate")
        g.add_edge("orchestrate", END)
        return g.compile()
```

For the exact decorator contract, route mapping, widget/public endpoints, `@cron`, `@on_job`, and `@venv`, use:

- [bundle-platform-integration-README.md](bundle-platform-integration-README.md)

## Decorator Matrix

| Decorator | Scope | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@agentic_workflow(...)` | entrypoint class | normal bundle registration |
| `@agentic_workflow_factory(...)` | factory function | custom workflow construction when class registration is not enough |
| `@bundle_id(...)` | entrypoint class | code-level bundle identity |
| `@api(...)` | entrypoint method | bundle HTTP operations and public endpoints |
| `@mcp(...)` | entrypoint method | bundle-served MCP endpoints |
| `@ui_widget(...)` | entrypoint method | widget manifest entries |
| `@ui_main` | entrypoint method | bundle main UI entrypoint |
| `@on_message` | entrypoint method | message-handler metadata |
| `@cron(...)` | entrypoint method | scheduled background jobs |
| `@on_job` | entrypoint method | ready background jobs claimed by proc from the jobs stream |
| `@venv(...)` | helper function or method | cached subprocess virtualenv execution for selected helpers |

Practical rule:

- most bundles need `@agentic_workflow(...)`, `@bundle_id(...)`, and optionally `@api(...)` / `@mcp(...)` / `@ui_widget(...)`
- use `@cron(...)` only for scheduled work
- use `@on_job` when work is submitted to the background job stream and must be executed later by proc
- use `@venv(...)` only for dependency-heavy leaf helpers, not general orchestration
- runtime feature gating uses canonical `enabled.*` switches in bundle props (see "Feature Gating With Canonical `enabled.*`" below)

Background job rule:

- `@cron(...)` decides when something is due; it should stay small and can enqueue ready work
- `@on_job` receives the ready job envelope later and executes it with a fresh runtime context
- `@on_job` is not an HTTP route and not a widget operation
- define at most one `@on_job` method per bundle
- make `@on_job` async
- keep bundle-specific job semantics in the job `work_kind`, `metadata`, and `payload`
- when deriving from SDK mixins, call `await super().handle_job(**kwargs)` first
  and return immediately if it reports `handled=true`; this lets mixins consume
  their own `work_kind` values without adding another `@on_job`
- use [background-jobs-README.md](../../service/streams/background-jobs-README.md) for the platform queue contract

Visibility rule:

- `user_types` on `@api(...)` and `@ui_widget(...)` are threshold-based, not exact-match
- order is:
  - `anonymous < registered < paid < privileged`
- so:
  - `user_types=("registered",)` means registered-or-higher
  - `user_types=("paid",)` means paid-or-higher
  - `user_types=("privileged",)` means privileged only
- use `roles=(...)` for raw external auth roles such as `kdcube:role:super-admin`
- if both `user_types` and `roles` are declared, both checks must pass
- `@mcp(...)` is different:
  - proc does not enforce `user_types`, `roles`, or `public_auth` for MCP
  - the bundle MCP app owns MCP request authentication/authorization

## Configuration Model

The important split is:

- platform/global config and secrets:
  - `get_settings()`
  - `await get_secret_async("canonical.key")` in async code
- non-secret bundle config:
  - `self.bundle_prop(...)`
  - code defaults -> `bundles.yaml` -> runtime/admin overrides
- bundle secrets:
  - `await get_secret_async("b:...")` in async code
  - provisioned through `bundles.secrets.yaml` or the configured secrets provider
- user-scoped bundle state:
  - `get_user_prop(...)`
  - `await get_user_secret_async(...)`
  - never exported back into descriptors
- raw mounted descriptor reads:
  - `get_plain(...)`
  - only when bundle code really must inspect descriptor files directly

Compatibility note:

- sync helpers such as `get_secret(...)` and `get_user_secret(...)` still exist
  for old sync-only code
- new async bundle paths should use async helpers so provider IO does not block
  the event loop directly

Read the exact model here:

- [../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)
- [bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md](bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md)
- [build/how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](build/how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)

## Feature Gating With Canonical `enabled.*`

The platform-native way to enable or disable bundle surfaces is the
`enabled.*` section of effective bundle props. The platform derives the
lookup path from decorator metadata, so there is one canonical place per
surface.

Mapping per decorator:

| Decorator | Canonical path |
| --- | --- |
| `@agentic_workflow(...)` | `enabled.bundle` |
| `@api(alias=A, method=M, ...)` | `enabled.api["A.M"]` (flat key, literal dot) |
| `@mcp(alias=A, ...)` | `enabled.mcp.A` |
| `@ui_widget(alias=A, ...)` | `enabled.widget.A` |
| `@cron(alias=A, ...)` | `enabled.cron.A` |

Aliases must not contain `.`; the validator rejects them at decoration time.
The flat `<alias>.<METHOD>` key under `enabled.api` is the only place a
literal dot appears inside a section key.

Example:

```python
@agentic_workflow(name="ops.dashboard", version="1.0.0")
@bundle_id("ops.dashboard@1.0.0")
class OpsDashboard(BaseEntrypoint):
    @ui_widget(
        alias="dashboard",
        icon={"tailwind": "heroicons-outline:chart-bar"},
        user_types=("privileged",),
    )
    def dashboard_widget(self, **kwargs):
        return ["<div>Dashboard</div>"]
```

```yaml
bundles:
  items:
    - id: "ops.dashboard@1.0.0"
      config:
        enabled:
          bundle: true
          widget:
            dashboard: false
```

Current rules:

- missing section, missing sub-section, or missing key means enabled
- bundle-level `enabled.bundle = false` overrides every resource-level value
- disabled values are:
  - `false`
  - `0`
  - `disable`
  - `disabled`
  - `off`
  - plus boolean `False` and integer `0`

Practical rule:

- keep the switches in bundle props under `bundles.yaml -> config: enabled: ...`
- do not invent parallel ad hoc `if self.bundle_prop(...): return 404` checks unless the logic is more complex than simple exposure gating

### Runtime overrides for decorator defaults

Beyond the on/off `enabled.*` switches, decorator defaults for `user_types`,
`roles`, `transport`, `cron_expression`, and `timezone` can additionally be
overridden from bundle props by declaring a `*_config` dot-path on the
decorator:

| Decorator | Overridable field | Parameter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@api(...)`, `@ui_widget(...)` | `user_types` | `user_types_config="..."` |
| `@api(...)`, `@ui_widget(...)` | `roles` | `roles_config="..."` |
| `@mcp(...)` | `transport` | `transport_config="..."` |
| `@cron(...)` | `cron_expression` | `expr_config="..."` |
| `@cron(...)` | `timezone` | `tz_config="..."` |

When the dot-path resolves against effective bundle props, the resolved value
replaces the decorator default at request/scheduling time. Empty list / blank
string / invalid types fall back to the decorator default; missing path also
falls back to the decorator default. The single exception is `@cron`'s
`expr_config`: with `expr_config` declared, a missing path means "do not
schedule" (see `bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md` for the full cron contract).

## Configuration Access Rules

Use the helper contract, not ad hoc access.

Required rules for bundle code:

- do not use `os.getenv(...)` or `os.environ[...]` for deployment-owned config
  or secrets
- do not call `get_secrets_manager(...).get_secret(...)` directly
- do not open descriptor YAML files through hardcoded paths

Use instead:

- `self.bundle_prop(...)` for effective bundle config
- `get_secret(...)` for deployment-scoped secrets
- `get_plain(...)` only for raw descriptor inspection
- `get_settings()` for effective typed platform/runtime settings

The only normal exception for raw env access is code that explicitly sits at
the iso-runtime or sandbox boundary and is intentionally driven by process env.

## Git Auth Environment Boundary

If bundle code needs to run git commands, treat git auth as subprocess configuration, not as mutable bundle-local process state.

Rules:

- read git configuration from the managed settings/secrets layer
- if you need a git subprocess env, build a per-call env dict and pass it to `subprocess.run(..., env=env)`
- do not write git auth values back into `os.environ` from bundle code

Important boundary:

- the processor process may already start with inherited `GIT_*` variables
- those inherited variables are shared by design across applications in the same processor
- explicit git helper overrides are local to the subprocess env dict and do not mutate the processor process env

Practical implication:

- do not assume one bundle can safely rewrite processor-level git auth for itself only
- if you need bundle-specific git auth, pass it as an explicit subprocess override instead of mutating global process env

Transport contract:

- git-backed repos may use either HTTPS or SSH remote forms
- if `GIT_HTTP_TOKEN` is configured, the shared helper prefers HTTPS token auth
- when HTTPS token auth is selected, an SSH-style remote may be normalized to HTTPS before git is called
- if SSH transport is intended, configure:
  - `GIT_SSH_KEY_PATH`
  - `GIT_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`
  - `GIT_SSH_STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING`

Practical rule:

- HTTPS + PAT is usually the simpler runtime/deployment path
- SSH is supported, but it is a stricter operational contract because key and known-hosts material
  must be present and mounted correctly

## Local Storage Rule

If your bundle needs local filesystem state on the proc instance, use the bundle-storage helper.

Do not:
- write mutable state next to the bundle source tree
- invent your own repo-relative `.runtime` directory for runtime data

Use:
- `self.bundle_storage_root()` when you want the bundle-scoped shared local root
- `bundle_storage_dir(...)` only when you are outside entrypoint code and therefore do not have `self.bundle_storage_root()`

Example:

```python
def _local_root(self) -> pathlib.Path:
    storage_root = self.bundle_storage_root()
    if storage_root is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Bundle storage root is unavailable.")
    local_root = storage_root / "_my_subsystem"
    local_root.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    return local_root
```

Use this for:
- local repo checkouts
- cached prepared files
- local cron workspace
- working state that should survive across requests on the same instance

This is separate from:
- `AIBundleStorage`
- descriptor-backed props/secrets

## Guarded Shared Build Rule

If that local storage contains a derived object that may be created by several
requests or workers, protect it with the platform guarded-build helpers. Common
examples are:

- an indexed knowledge registry behind an MCP endpoint
- a local mirror derived from a git repo or remote API
- a generated search index
- a prepared model/resource bundle

Do not rely on "this usually runs once" assumptions. A local CLI/docker-compose
runtime and a cloud runtime can both have concurrent workers touching the same
mounted bundle-storage path.

Use:

- `kdcube_ai_app.storage.observed_file_locks.observed_file_lock(...)` when the
  bundle owns the signature and readiness checks
- `observed_file_lock_async(...)` in async code that must not block while
  waiting
- the platform UI build configuration for main UI and widgets; `BaseEntrypoint`
  already uses the higher-level `bundle_once.py` helper for UI outputs

Pattern:

1. check `signature + ready` before taking the lock
2. acquire the lock with a bounded wait
3. check `signature + ready` again under the lock
4. build the object
5. verify readiness
6. write the signature last

Detailed helper usage:

- [../../service/synch-mechanisms/critical-section-README.md](../../service/synch-mechanisms/critical-section-README.md)

## Local Development Loop

Recommended local loop:

1. mount your bundle under the configured host bundles root
2. point `bundles.yaml` to the container-visible bundle path such as `/bundles/my.bundle`
3. install or rebuild once:

```bash
kdcube --descriptors-location <dir> --build
```

4. after each code or descriptor change, reload:

```bash
kdcube reload my.bundle@1.0.0 --workdir <runtime-workdir>
```

What `kdcube reload` does:

- reapplies the bundle registry from descriptor/env state
- rebuilds descriptor-backed bundle props from `bundles.yaml`
- clears in-process proc bundle caches so new requests use the updated code/config

Use this when you changed:

- bundle code
- `bundles.yaml`
- `bundles.secrets.yaml`

If your bundle uses local bundle storage, `kdcube reload` does not wipe that storage automatically.
Design your subsystem roots intentionally:
- stable bundle root for all bundle-managed local data
- explicit `_subsystem` roots for mutable local working state
- optional bundle-owned subdirectories for rebuildable caches if you intentionally need them

If you need the deployment-side details and registry behavior, use:

- [bundle-delivery-and-update-README.md](bundle-delivery-and-update-README.md)
- [build/how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](build/how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)

## Reference Bundle Scope

The reference bundle is `versatile@2026-03-31-13-36`.

It intentionally demonstrates:

- a normal React bundle entrypoint
- economics-enabled entrypoint
- bundle-local tools
- bundle-local skills
- props and secrets
- widget operations
- custom main UI
- MCP connector descriptors
- public endpoint example
- direct isolated-exec operation

It does **not** currently demonstrate every bundle surface. In particular:

- it is not the reference for `@cron`
- it is not the reference for `@venv`

For those, use the dedicated docs:

- [bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md](bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md)
- [bundle-venv-README.md](bundle-venv-README.md)

For bundle widgets and main UI integration, use:

- [bundle-widget-integration-README.md](bundle-widget-integration-README.md)

When a widget needs a platform-owned UI capability inside the same React tree,
use the shared-source pattern from that doc instead of duplicating panels in the
bundle. Current reusable examples are:

- User Memory: `sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories`
- Telegram admin/channels: `sdk://integrations/telegram/ui/widget.telegram`

The bundle still owns route aliases, role policy, Telegram identity mapping,
and operation callers. Shared widget components are UI source, not backend
authorization.

## Validation

Shared SDK bundle suite:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
python -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tests.bundle.run_bundle_suite \
  --bundle-path /abs/path/to/bundle
```

Use `<bundle>/tests` for bundle-specific behavior that is not part of the generic SDK contract.
