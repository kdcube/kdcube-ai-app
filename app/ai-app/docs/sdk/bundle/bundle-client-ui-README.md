# Bundle Client UI

This section is the browser/UI entry point for bundle developers.

Use it when your bundle ships:

- widgets
- a custom main UI
- a custom frontend calling `/api/integrations/*`
- frontend code that must consume chat stream events correctly

## Read Order

1. [bundle-client-communication-README.md](bundle-client-communication-README.md)
   The transport/auth contract: supported headers, cookies, query params, response headers, SSE vs Socket.IO, and how REST requests can target one connected peer.
2. [bundle-widget-integration-README.md](bundle-widget-integration-README.md)
   Widget source-folder layout, iframe config handshake, operation URL shape, and widget/API split.
3. [bundle-chat-stream-events-README.md](bundle-chat-stream-events-README.md)
   The shared SSE + Socket.IO chat stream event catalog and envelope shape.
4. [bundle-frontend-awareness-README.md](bundle-frontend-awareness-README.md)
   Retry, draining, rate-limit, reconnect, and multi-tab behavior.

## Source Layout

KDCube has two browser-facing bundle UI surfaces with the same build paradigm
and separate source subtrees.

Use `ui/main` for the bundle main view:

```yaml
ui:
  main_view:
    src_folder: ui/main
    build_command: npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build
```

Use a widget-specific folder for widgets:

```yaml
ui:
  widgets:
    task_memo_webapp:
      enabled: true
      src_folder: ui/widgets/task_memo_webapp
      build_command: npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build
```

Do not put widget app source under `ui/main`. That name is reserved by
convention for main-view source. A bundle may have both:

```text
my_bundle/
  ui/
    main/                    # main view
    widgets/
      task_memo_webapp/      # widget app
```

Both source folders are built by bundle-loader infrastructure into shared
bundle storage. Bundle code and operators should edit source, not the built
runtime storage directory.

Widget source-folder config is per alias. A bundle can define
`ui.widgets.task_memo_webapp.src_folder/build_command` and still inherit
method-rendered widgets such as `ai_bundles` from `BaseEntrypoint`; those
inherited widgets keep using their Python-rendered HTML unless their own alias
is also configured as a source-folder widget.

Source-folder widgets also have a public static route for launch surfaces such
as Telegram Mini Apps:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/public/widgets/{widget_alias}
```

Use that only to serve the app shell/assets. Public widget APIs still need their
own request authentication, such as Telegram `initData` verification.

For one widget codebase that runs in both KDCube and Telegram:

- detect Telegram with `window.Telegram?.WebApp?.initData`
- in KDCube, wait for iframe parent config and call `/operations/{alias}`
- in Telegram, skip parent config, call `/public/{telegram_alias}`, and send
  `X-Telegram-Init-Data`
- keep admin-only panels behind KDCube-authenticated operations, not Telegram
  Mini App public APIs

## Scope

Use these docs when you need to know:

- how bundle UIs authenticate over REST, SSE, Socket.IO, and integrations
- which cookies and headers are supported
- which values are configurable by env
- how `stream_id` and `KDC-Stream-ID` affect peer-targeted delivery
- which response headers and retry signals the client should honor

This is no longer a separate top-level client namespace. These docs live under bundle because bundle code now owns widgets, main UI apps, and custom frontend interactions.
