# Bundle Lifecycle

This doc explains the **runtime lifecycle** of a bundle and the **storage/config surfaces** available to it.

Read it together with:

- [Bundle Runtime](bundle-runtime-README.md) for request/tool runtime surfaces
- [Bundle Interfaces](bundle-interfaces-README.md) for streaming/widgets/operations
- [Client Communication](bundle-client-communication-README.md) when the bundle also ships client code
- [Bundle Longrun Design](build/design/@longrun-README.md) for the proposed
  future lifecycle for supervised bundle-owned long-running tasks

## Mental model

Write bundle code as **stateless per invocation**.

Even if a deployment enables singleton reuse, durable bundle state should live in:
- bundle props
- secrets
- Redis KV cache
- bundle storage backend
- shared local bundle storage
- cached per-bundle venvs for decorated external Python callables

Do **not** rely on Python instance fields as durable cross-request state.

Critical discovery rule:

- the first lifecycle phase is module import
- bundle-local Python imports must be package-relative before decorators,
  hooks, or runtime methods can be discovered
- see [Bundle Runtime](bundle-runtime-README.md#critical-bundle-local-import-rule)
  for the full import-isolation contract

## Main phases

| Phase | When | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | Proc startup / bundle load | Loader imports the bundle module and finds the class decorated with `@bundle_entrypoint` |
| Instantiation | Per request by default | Entrypoint instance is created with `config`, `comm_context`, `pg_pool`, `redis` |
| One-time init | Once per process per tenant/project | `on_bundle_load(...)` may prepare indexes, local caches, repos, or other bundle-local assets |
| Request prep | Every invocation | Request-bound routing/identity is rebuilt, singleton instances are rebound, bundle props are loaded/merged, hooks can run |
| Scheduled due scan | According to `@cron(...)` | The cron method may detect due work and enqueue ready jobs; it should stay small and idempotent |
| Background job invocation | When proc claims a jobs-stream item | Proc rebuilds bundle runtime context and invokes the async `@on_job(job=...)` method |
| Execution | Every invocation | `execute_core(...)` handles the chat turn or bundle operation |
| Decorated external execution | On demand inside an invocation | `@venv(...)` functions run in a cached per-bundle subprocess venv; the venv is rebuilt only when its `requirements.txt` hash changes |
| Success completion | Successful invocation | `post_run_hook(...)` can finalize success-only bookkeeping |
| Turn finalization | Every invocation after completion, error, or cancellation | `on_turn_completed(...)` can release per-turn resources; it must be fast and idempotent |

## Instance lifetime

### Default mental model

Treat each incoming chat turn or operation call as a fresh invocation:
- one request
- one execution path
- one result

### Singleton reuse

The registry may enable `singleton=true`.

If that happens:
- the entrypoint instance may be reused
- the singleton cache is by loaded bundle spec in the current proc worker, not by request
- the same singleton instance may therefore serve multiple turns and REST operations over time
- `rebind_request_context(...)` refreshes request-bound objects such as `comm_context`
- `on_bundle_load(...)` still runs only once per process per tenant/project

Important precision:

- singleton reuse is **not** keyed by `tenant/project`
- singleton reuse is **not** keyed by `bundle_id` alone
- the cache key is the loaded bundle spec (`path + module`) in the current worker

Operationally, the bundle registry still exposes one active loaded spec for a
given `bundle_id` at a time, so different refs of the same `bundle_id` do not
normally coexist as active runtime entries in one worker.

Even with singleton reuse, you should still treat runtime memory as ephemeral and non-authoritative.

Important:
- singleton reuse does **not** make `self.comm`, current actor, current user, current conversation, or current turn durable
- those are per-invocation surfaces and must be treated as request-local
- do not cache request-bound values from one call and reuse them in another
- platform does not serialize singleton invocations for you; bundle code may still be used concurrently
- what the platform guarantees is that request execution context is rebound per invocation and must not live as shared singleton state

## Entrypoint methods and timing

| Method | Frequency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `on_bundle_load(**kwargs)` | once per process per tenant/project | build indexes, warm caches, clone repos, prepare local read-only assets |
| `on_props_changed(...)` | when effective props changed for the active instance | reconcile long-lived side effects after props refresh |
| `pre_run_hook(state=...)` | every invocation | last-minute validation or reconciliation |
| `execute_core(state=..., thread_id=..., params=...)` | every invocation | main bundle logic |
| `@on_job` handler | each claimed background job | execute ready work from the jobs stream with explicit job metadata/payload |
| `post_run_hook(state=..., result=...)` | successful invocation | final success-only bookkeeping |
| `on_turn_completed(state=..., result=..., error=..., status=..., reason=...)` | after success, error, or cancellation | best-effort per-turn cleanup; called by the proc bundle runner, with a short timeout |
| `rebind_request_context(...)` | singleton reuse only | refresh request-local handles on cached instance before the current call runs |

Important:
- `on_bundle_load(...)` is intended to be deterministic and idempotent
- `on_turn_completed(...)` is for fast cleanup only; do not do expensive reporting or user-facing work there
- do not store request-local state there
- use storage for durable state, not instance fields

`on_props_changed(...)` is different from `on_bundle_load(...)`:

- it runs after effective bundle props changed
- it is for reconciling long-lived side effects, not for request-local logic
- it should also be deterministic and idempotent
- it should not block on slow one-time install/build work that belongs in
  `on_bundle_load(...)`

`@venv(...)` is separate from `on_bundle_load(...)`:
- it is not a one-time init hook
- it is evaluated lazily when the decorated callable is invoked
- it uses bundle-managed local storage for its cached venv
- it should be treated as an execution boundary, not as part of the shared proc instance lifecycle
- its cache key is effectively one venv per bundle id
- code reload and venv rebuild are separate:
  - Python source changes still require normal bundle reload in proc
  - `requirements.txt` changes rebuild the cached venv on the next decorated call

## Request-bound communicator and REST operations

Bundle operations use the same request-bound communicator model as normal chat turns.

For each REST call to:
- `/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/operations/{operation}`
- `/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/public/{operation}`

proc builds a fresh `ChatTaskPayload` from the current request/session:
- tenant and project
- user/session identity
- request id
- bundle id
- stream/socket id when the client propagated it

That `comm_context` is passed into `get_workflow_instance(...)`.

What happens next depends on instance lifetime:

- non-singleton bundle:
  - a fresh entrypoint instance is created for the request
  - `self.comm_context` is request-local from the start
  - `self.comm` is built from that request context
- singleton bundle:
  - the cached instance is reused
  - before the operation runs, `rebind_request_context(...)` refreshes request-local state
  - for `BaseEntrypoint`, rebinding updates task-local request context so `self.comm_context` / `self.comm` resolve against the current invocation instead of shared instance state
  - the shared singleton object may still hold bundle-owned shared state, but request execution context must be treated as per-invocation only

So yes: the bundle does receive a request-specific communicator for REST calls, but it is passed indirectly through `comm_context`, not as a separate operation argument.

Practical rule:
- inside bundle code, use `self.comm` / `self.comm_context` as request-bound surfaces
- if the bundle is singleton, never retain an old communicator reference across requests
- use `bundle_call_context` for small bundle-owned metadata that must follow
  this invocation into tools, nested agents, and isolated runtimes

For custom singleton bundles that do not use `BaseEntrypoint`, the platform now
also exposes request-local helpers via `kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx`:
- `get_current_request_context()`
- `get_current_comm()`
- `get_current_bundle_call_context()`
- `update_current_bundle_call_context(...)`
- `bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch(...)`

Those helpers are bound by the platform for queued `run(...)` execution and for
REST/widget invocation paths. Use them instead of storing request execution
context on the shared singleton object.

## Background job invocation

Background jobs use a different inbound path from chat and REST, but they still
run inside proc with a rebuilt bundle runtime context.

Flow:

1. A producer such as `@cron(...)`, a widget/API "run now" operation, or an
   internal service detects ready work.
2. The producer creates any bundle-owned domain record first, for example a
   queued execution record.
3. The producer enqueues a job to the Redis background job stream.
4. The processor claims the stream item, applies the normal task lock, and builds
   a `ChatTaskPayload` with operation `__kdcube_on_job__`.
5. Proc loads/rebinds the bundle and calls the discovered async `@on_job` method.
6. The stream item is acknowledged only after the handler returns.

Lifecycle implications:

- `@on_job` is not called by HTTP routing and has no public URL
- `@on_job` must be async
- define at most one `@on_job` handler per bundle
- the job envelope is the handoff contract; bundle-owned fields live in
  `work_kind`, `metadata`, and `payload`
- `bundle_call_context` is the reserved JSON context that proc snapshots and
  restores into nested runtimes; use it for task/execution metadata tools must
  inherit without model-supplied arguments
- background job processing seeds `bundle_call_context` from the job envelope:
  `kind`, `job_id`, `work_kind`, `source`, `metadata`, and `payload`
- if a producer needs a later `@on_job` handler to inherit request-scoped model
  routing, selected agent strength, or other call metadata, put those fields in
  the job metadata/payload and have the handler re-apply them through
  `update_current_bundle_call_context(...)` or
  `bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch(...)`
- the handler should assume retry is possible until the stream message is acked
- cron should decide what is due; `@on_job` should execute the ready job
- long-running per-user work should be queued as jobs instead of executed inside
  the scheduler tick
- reusable SDK mixins should expose `handle_job(...)`; the final bundle
  entrypoint keeps one decorated `@on_job` and calls
  `await super().handle_job(**kwargs)` before local job dispatch

See:

- [background-jobs-README.md](../../service/streams/background-jobs-README.md)

## What changes apply to new requests

Three classes of changes matter during bundle development:

1. **Runtime/admin prop overrides**
   - stored in Redis
   - picked up by `refresh_bundle_props(...)` at invocation start
   - affect new requests immediately
   - fire `on_props_changed(...)` when the effective props actually changed

2. **Descriptor-backed bundle config**
   - comes from `bundles.yaml`
   - affects new requests after proc reapplies the descriptor (`reset-env` / `kdcube bundle reload`)

3. **Bundle code changes**
   - require proc cache eviction before the next request should load the updated module
   - for local development, the intended path is:
     - `kdcube bundle reload <bundle_id> --workdir <runtime-workdir>`

4. **`@venv` requirements changes**
   - if only `requirements.txt` changed, the next call to the decorated function will rebuild the cached venv automatically
   - if Python source code changed, proc still needs the normal bundle reload so the updated module is imported before the next request
   - if both code and requirements changed, do the normal reload; the venv rebuild will then happen lazily on the next decorated call

Practical rule:

- current in-flight requests continue with the code/config they already loaded
- new requests pick up:
  - Redis prop edits immediately
  - descriptor/code changes after proc cache clear + descriptor replay
  - `requirements.txt` changes for `@venv` callables when that callable is next invoked

## `on_props_changed(...)` contract

`BaseEntrypoint` now exposes:

```python
async def on_props_changed(
    *,
    previous_props: Dict[str, Any],
    current_props: Dict[str, Any],
    reason: str = "refresh_bundle_props",
    tenant: Optional[str] = None,
    project: Optional[str] = None,
    updated_by: Optional[str] = None,
    source: Optional[str] = None,
) -> None:
    ...
```

When it runs:

- after `refresh_bundle_props(...)` if effective props changed for the current invocation
- after live `bundles.props.update` for already-loaded singleton bundle instances in the current worker

When it does **not** run:

- if effective props did not change
- for a bundle instance that is not loaded in the current worker yet

Practical use cases:

- clear Python-side caches derived from props
- mark long-lived helpers dirty
- reconcile side effects that must track bundle props
- split startup config vs live config for internal sidecars

Do not use it for:

- request-local validation
- main business execution
- slow first-time initialization that belongs in `on_bundle_load(...)`

For sidecar-backed bundles, the common pattern is:

- `on_props_changed(...)` updates Python-side wrapper state
- the next sidecar call decides whether startup fingerprint changed
- restart or live reconfigure then happens lazily at the bridge boundary

## `@venv(...)` in the lifecycle

`@venv(...)` allows selected bundle callables to run in a cached per-bundle subprocess venv while the rest of the bundle remains in the shared proc interpreter.

Current runtime behavior:
- the decorated callable is the boundary
- proc serializes the call arguments and return value across the subprocess boundary
- the runtime resolves the bundle id and bundle root
- the runtime creates or reuses a cached venv under bundle-managed local storage at `_bundle_venvs/<bundle-id>`
- the venv is created from the selected base Python (`python=` override when set, otherwise the current runtime base interpreter)
- the venv reuses platform/runtime packages by writing a runtime overlay `.pth`
- bundle-specific requirements are then installed on top of that runtime layer from the bundle's `requirements.txt`
- the callable is executed in a subprocess using that venv's Python
- the result is deserialized back into proc

Current cache rule:
- one cached venv per bundle id
- rebuild only when the referenced `requirements.txt` content hash changes

Practical implications:
- use `@venv(...)` for dependency-heavy leaf jobs
- keep communicator use, DB/Redis pooled access, and request-bound runtime objects in proc
- pass serializable data into the decorated callable and return serializable data out
- bundle-local dataclasses and similar bundle-defined types are acceptable only when they live in normal importable bundle modules
- do not treat `@venv(...)` as a generic transport for framework request objects, DB pools, Redis clients, or live SDK runtime handles
- do not assume proc-bound runtime helpers exist in the child; `self.comm`, `self.comm_context`, `get_current_comm()`, `get_current_request_context()`, `TOOL_SUBSYSTEM`, `COMMUNICATOR`, `KV_CACHE`, and `CTX_CLIENT` are proc-side surfaces, not venv-child surfaces

- [Bundle Venv](bundle-venv-README.md)

## Storage and isolation surfaces

| Surface | Access | Isolation | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bundle_props` | read | tenant + project + bundle | effective non-secret configuration |
| `await get_secret(...)` | read | secret key namespace | API keys, tokens, credentials |
| `await get_secret("u:...")`, `await set_user_secret(...)`, `await delete_user_secret(...)` | read/write | tenant + project + bundle + user | per-user tokens and credentials |
| Redis KV cache | read/write | whatever keys you choose | lightweight distributed state, flags, small caches |
| `BundleArtifactStorage` | read/write | tenant + project + bundle | persistent bundle artifact data through the runtime-configured backend |
| `self.bundle_storage_root()` | read/write by bundle code | tenant + project + bundle | large local/EFS caches, cloned repos, indexes, read-only assets |
| Current turn `OUT_DIR` / `workdir` | read/write during execution | current invocation | transient turn files, generated artifacts, isolated exec inputs/outputs |

```

## User, tenant, and request context

Bundle code can access request identity through the request context:
- tenant
- project
- user / actor metadata
- conversation and turn ids

This context is request-bound. Do not cache it as durable bundle state.

## Custom bundle UI

A bundle can ship a custom frontend (a Vite/React SPA) that is built once at load time
and served to the browser as a standalone panel.

### How it works

1. Configure `ui.main_view` in `bundle_props` (code defaults or `bundles.yaml`):

```python
@property
def configuration(self):
    return {
        "ui": {
            "main_view": {
                "src_folder": "ui/main",          # relative to bundle root
                "build_command": "npm install && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build",
            }
        }
    }
```

2. `on_bundle_load(...)` calls `_ensure_ui_build()` which:
   - resolves `src_folder` relative to the bundle root
   - runs `build_command` (with `<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH>` substituted)
   - stores the build output under `<bundle_storage_root>/ui/`
   - writes a `.ui.signature` file so the build is skipped on subsequent loads if nothing changed

If an entrypoint subclasses `BaseEntrypoint` or a derived memory/economics
entrypoint and overrides `on_bundle_load(...)`, it must keep the base lifecycle:

```python
async def on_bundle_load(self, **kwargs):
    if kwargs.get("comm_context") is not None:
        self.comm_context = kwargs["comm_context"]
    if kwargs.get("pg_pool") is not None:
        self.pg_pool = kwargs["pg_pool"]
    if kwargs.get("redis") is not None:
        self.redis = kwargs["redis"]

    await super().on_bundle_load(**kwargs)
    await self._prepare_bundle_specific_state()
```

The base hook refreshes bundle props and calls `_ensure_ui_build()`. Skipping it
is the common cause of widgets building only on first selection even though
bundle preload is enabled.

3. The built SPA is served by the processor's static endpoint:

```
GET /api/integrations/static/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/{path}
```

The endpoint computes the content hash of the bundle directory (same algorithm as
the UI build signature inputs to decide whether the SPA needs rebuilding, then
serves files from the stable `<bundle_storage_root>/ui/` subtree. Missing paths
fall back to `index.html` for client-side routing.

### Notes

- The UI is built per process per tenant/project (same cadence as `on_bundle_load`).
- `node_modules/` and related generated folders are excluded from the build signature so that
  dependency installation during the build does not rotate the build cache unnecessarily.
- The built UI typically communicates back to the backend through the bundle operations
  endpoint (`POST /api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/operations/{operation}`)
  and receives runtime config (base URL, auth tokens, tenant/project) through the
  runtime UI config bridge.
- Legacy callers may still use
  `POST /api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/operations/{operation}`.
  When `bundle_id` is omitted there, proc resolves the current default bundle id.
- That UI is a normal platform client. If it needs bundle-originated progress or
  step events to target one exact connected peer, it must follow the client
  communication contract and propagate the connected peer id on REST requests.
- Reference implementation:
  - `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/versatile@2026-03-31-13-36/entrypoint.py`
  - `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/versatile@2026-03-31-13-36/ui/main/src/App.tsx`
  That example shows a lightweight chat main view with bundle-scoped conversation browsing on top of the runtime UI config handshake plus chat REST/SSE endpoints.
- See:
  [bundle-client-communication-README.md](bundle-client-communication-README.md)
  and [docs/sdk/bundle/bundle-runtime-README.md](bundle-runtime-README.md)

## React integration

If a bundle uses the React agent:
- teach the agent bundle-specific behavior with skills
- expose bundle tools via `tools_descriptor.py`
- optionally expose `ks:` as a read-only logical namespace
- optionally back `ks:` from shared local bundle storage

See:
- [bundle-knowledge-space-README.md](bundle-knowledge-space-README.md)
- [../agents/react/react-turn-workspace-README.md](../agents/react/react-turn-workspace-README.md)

## Practical rules

- Use `on_bundle_load(...)` for heavy preparation that should happen before requests rely on it.
- Persist durable state in storage, not on `self`.
- Use shared local bundle storage for large local reusable assets.
- Use the bundle storage backend or Redis for distributed state that must survive host changes.
- Treat `OUT_DIR` and `workdir` as per-invocation execution state, not bundle state.
