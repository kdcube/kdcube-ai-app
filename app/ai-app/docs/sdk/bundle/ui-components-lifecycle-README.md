# UI Components Lifecycle

Use this doc when you need to understand why a bundle UI surface appears in the
control plane, when its source folder is built, where the built files are
stored, and what happens under concurrent proc workers.

This page covers source-folder UI components:

- bundle main view configured by `ui.main_view`
- bundle widgets configured by `ui.widgets.<alias>`
- shared SDK UI sources copied by `shared_sources`

For deciding whether an app should ship KDCube-served UI at all, or instead be
consumed by a direct host browser/server client as a backend-only app, start
with [How To Integrate With KDCube Apps](../../how-to-integrate-with-kdcube-apps-README.md).

It does not describe chat message rendering, ReAct artifacts, or generated
runtime widgets inside model output.

## Runtime Context

Bundle UI builds run inside the chat **proc** service, not inside ISO runtime.
The proc worker that performs the build uses normal Python code plus `npm` /
`vite` subprocesses.

Execution contexts:

| Context | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Proc worker lifespan | Loads registry, prefetches git bundles, starts optional bundle preload. |
| Proc preload task | Imports bundles and runs `on_bundle_load()` for configured bundles. |
| Proc request handler | Serves widget/main-view routes and may trigger a build if output is missing. |
| Build subprocess | Runs `npm install`, `npm ci`, `vite build`, or the configured command. |
| Shared storage | Stores built UI files, signatures, temporary source/output, and locks. |
| ISO runtime | Not involved in UI component builds. |

In ECS, Docker Compose, or any multi-worker deployment, each Uvicorn worker is a
separate Python process. Workers share bundle storage through the configured
storage root, but they do not share Python module caches, process-local preload
state, or process-local request state.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Browser["Browser iframe request"]
  Proxy["Ingress / proxy"]
  W1["proc worker pid=65"]
  W2["proc worker pid=66"]
  Storage["shared bundle storage<br/>/bundle-storage/..."]
  Redis["Redis / registry / coordination"]

  Browser --> Proxy
  Proxy --> W1
  Proxy --> W2
  W1 <--> Storage
  W2 <--> Storage
  W1 <--> Redis
  W2 <--> Redis
```

The route may reach any worker inside the proc task. Therefore every worker
must be able to load the same bundle surfaces from the authoritative bundle
path, and every build must be guarded by shared-storage signatures and locks.

## Surface Discovery Versus Build Config

A widget needs a declared surface. A static build config is not enough.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Decorator["@ui_widget(alias='x')"]
  Manifest["bundle interface manifest"]
  Toolbar["control-plane widget list"]
  Route["/api/integrations/bundles/.../widgets/x"]
  Config["ui.widgets.x"]
  Build["static source build"]
  Serve["serve built index.html/assets"]

  Decorator --> Manifest
  Manifest --> Toolbar
  Manifest --> Route
  Config --> Build
  Route --> Config
  Build --> Serve
```

The contracts are:

- `@ui_widget(alias="x")` declares that widget `x` exists.
- `ui.widgets.x` says widget `x` should be served as a built static app.
- `enabled.widget.x` enables or disables the widget surface.
- `ui.widgets.x.enabled` enables or disables the static-app config for
  that surface.

If `@ui_widget(alias="x")` exists and `ui.widgets.x` does not exist,
the route invokes the decorated Python method.

If `ui.widgets.x` exists and `@ui_widget(alias="x")` does not exist,
the config does not create a widget. The widget route has no surface to resolve
and should fail as an undefined widget.

If both exist, static serving wins for that alias. The decorated method remains
the authoritative manifest surface; the browser receives the built files from
`<bundle_storage_root>/ui/widgets/x` when `ui.widgets.x.src_folder` and
`build_command` are active.

Inherited widgets follow the same rule. A child entrypoint that inherits
`@ui_widget(alias="x")` from a parent has already declared widget `x`. It can:

- suppress the surface with `enabled.widget.x: false`
- replace the served UI with `ui.widgets.x.src_folder/build_command`
- override the same Python method name if it must change decorator metadata

It must not add a different decorated method with the same alias. Duplicate
aliases are rejected during manifest discovery.

Do not confuse these flags:

| Config | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled.widget.x: false` | disables the widget surface; route/listing treats it as unavailable |
| `ui.widgets.x.enabled: false` | disables only the static source-folder app for `x`; an existing decorated method may still be served |

Main views are separate:

- `ui.main_view` configures the bundle main view build.
- `ui.widgets.<alias>` configures widget builds.
- A main view is not a widget and does not make a widget toolbar icon appear.

## Config Sources

The effective UI config is built from bundle defaults plus descriptor props.

Bundle code usually owns stable build wiring:

```python
def configuration_defaults(self):
    return {
        "ui": {
            "widgets": {
                "telegram_miniapp": {
                    "enabled": False,
                    "src_folder": "ui/widgets/telegram_miniapp",
                    "build_command": "npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build",
                    "shared_sources": {
                        "memory_widget": {
                            "src_folder": "sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories",
                            "target": "_shared/memory-widget",
                        },
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    }
```

Deployment descriptors usually own environment policy:

```yaml
config:
  enabled:
    widget:
      memories: false
  ui:
    widgets:
      telegram_miniapp:
        enabled: true
```

For built-in/reference bundles, prefer putting `src_folder`, `build_command`,
and required `shared_sources` in `configuration_defaults()`. This avoids
forcing every deployment descriptor to repeat internal source wiring.

## Build Inputs And Outputs

For a widget alias `x`, the builder uses:

| Item | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Source folder | `<bundle_root>/<src_folder>` or a resolved `bundle://` / `sdk://` path |
| Temporary source | `<bundle_storage_root>/.ui.src.tmp.<pid>.<uuid>` |
| Temporary output | `<bundle_storage_root>/.ui.build.tmp.<pid>.<uuid>` |
| Final widget output | `<bundle_storage_root>/ui/widgets/x` |
| Widget signature | `<bundle_storage_root>/.ui.widgets/x.signature` |
| Widget lock | `<bundle_storage_root>/.kdcube.once/ui-widget-x.lock` |
| Main-view output | `<bundle_storage_root>/ui` |
| Main-view signature | `<bundle_storage_root>/.ui.signature` |
| Main-view lock | `<bundle_storage_root>/.kdcube.once/ui-main-view.lock` |

The final output must contain `index.html`. For Vite apps, assets should be
relative to the widget route, normally by setting `base: './'`.

## Build Algorithm

For each configured main view or widget:

1. Resolve the bundle storage root.
2. Resolve the bundle root.
3. Resolve `src_folder`.
4. Resolve and validate `shared_sources`.
5. Compute a signature from:
   - component kind (`main-view` or `widget:<alias>`)
   - source path
   - build command
   - bundle delivery id
   - source tree signature
   - shared source tree signatures
6. If signature is current and `index.html` exists, skip.
7. Acquire a shared-storage lock.
8. Copy source into a temporary build source folder.
9. Copy each `shared_sources` item into its configured target under the
   temporary source folder.
10. Run the configured build command in the temporary source folder.
11. Require temporary output `index.html`.
12. Atomically swap temporary output into the final output folder.
13. Write the signature.
14. Release the lock.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Start["ensure UI build"]
  SigCurrent{"signature current<br/>and index.html exists?"}
  Lock["acquire shared-storage lock"]
  Copy["copy source + shared_sources<br/>to .ui.src.tmp"]
  Build["run npm/vite subprocess<br/>OUTDIR=.ui.build.tmp"]
  Valid{"temp index.html exists?"}
  Swap["atomic swap temp output<br/>to final ui path"]
  Sig["write signature"]
  Done["serve or preload complete"]
  Fail["raise build error"]

  Start --> SigCurrent
  SigCurrent -- yes --> Done
  SigCurrent -- no --> Lock
  Lock --> Copy
  Copy --> Build
  Build --> Valid
  Valid -- no --> Fail
  Valid -- yes --> Swap
  Swap --> Sig
  Sig --> Done
```

The source folder is never modified by the builder. `npm install` runs inside
the copied temporary source tree.

## Startup Preload

When app preload is enabled, each proc worker starts a preload task during
lifespan startup. All workers see the same registry, but they coordinate the
shared work through Redis so startup can be collaborative instead of duplicated.

Preload does this per worker:

1. Wait for git bundle prefetch to finish.
2. Load the active bundle registry.
3. Compute a stable preload generation for each configured app from its
   descriptor-resolved id, path, module, singleton flag, repo/ref/subdir, and
   git commit.
4. Skip the app if the Redis `preload-done` key already exists for that
   generation.
5. Claim one not-yet-done app generation with a Redis `SET NX` lock.
6. Import the app, run `on_bundle_load()`, and validate the discovered
   interface manifest.
7. Mark that app generation done in Redis after success.
8. Record per-app failures without making the whole proc fail.

Bundles that build UI in `on_bundle_load()` will build during this preload pass.
The Redis app-generation claim decides which worker should run the preload for
that app. Shared-storage signatures and locks remain as the final guard around
actual UI artifact writes under EFS or any other shared filesystem.

Claim keys are heartbeat-renewed while the worker is alive. If the worker or ECS
task dies mid-preload, the claim expires and another worker can retry. The
generation-specific done key prevents workers that start later from repeating
the same already completed preload.

For entrypoints that subclass `BaseEntrypoint` or one of its memory/economics
variants, the default `on_bundle_load()` refreshes effective bundle props and
calls `_ensure_ui_build()`. If your bundle overrides `on_bundle_load()`, preserve
that base lifecycle:

```python
async def on_bundle_load(self, **kwargs):
    if kwargs.get("pg_pool") is not None:
        self.pg_pool = kwargs["pg_pool"]
    if kwargs.get("redis") is not None:
        self.redis = kwargs["redis"]
    if kwargs.get("comm_context") is not None:
        self.comm_context = kwargs["comm_context"]

    await super().on_bundle_load(**kwargs)  # refresh props + build configured UI
    await self._prepare_bundle_specific_indexes()
```

If the override skips `super().on_bundle_load(...)`, `ui.widgets.*.src_folder`
may be valid and the bundle may still load, but startup preload will not build
those widget assets. The first live widget request then has to build them.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant W1 as proc worker pid=65
  participant W2 as proc worker pid=66
  participant R as Redis coordination
  participant S as shared bundle storage

  W1->>R: claim app generation A
  W2->>R: claim app generation B
  W1->>S: build app A widget assets under shared-storage lock
  W2->>S: build app B widget assets under shared-storage lock
  W1->>R: mark app generation A done
  W2->>R: mark app generation B done
  W2->>R: sees app generation A done, skip
  W1->>R: sees app generation B done, skip
```

Preload is an optimization and a readiness signal. Serving code still has a
request-time fallback because bundles can be reloaded or a storage mount can be
empty after restart.

## Request-Time Static Widget Serving

When the browser opens:

```text
GET /api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/widgets/{alias}/index.html
```

or a public launcher opens:

```text
GET /api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/public/widgets/{alias}/index.html
```

the route does this:

1. Load the bundle entrypoint for that request's worker.
2. Discover the bundle interface manifest from decorators.
3. Apply effective bundle props to the workflow.
4. Resolve `@ui_widget(alias="<alias>")`.
5. Check endpoint visibility and `enabled.widget.<alias>`.
6. Check whether `ui.widgets.<alias>` is active.
7. For `index.html`, run a process-local entrypoint-load task once per
   tenant/project/bundle/widget/storage key.
8. That entrypoint load may call bundle defaults and `on_bundle_load()`.
9. If output still does not exist, call `_ensure_ui_build()` from the workflow.
10. Serve `index.html`, injecting a route-aware `<base href>` for either
    `.../widgets/<alias>/` or `.../public/widgets/<alias>/`.
11. Serve assets from the same route family, with immutable cache headers for
    `assets/*`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser iframe
  participant W as proc worker
  participant P as Bundle workflow
  participant S as Shared storage

  B->>W: GET /widgets/x/index.html
  W->>P: load workflow and discover @ui_widget x
  W->>P: apply effective props
  W->>S: check /ui/widgets/x/index.html
  alt output missing or entrypoint not loaded in this worker
    W->>P: load defaults / on_bundle_load()
    P->>S: build under shared lock if signature missing
  end
  W->>S: read built index.html
  W-->>B: 200 text/html
  B->>W: GET /widgets/x/assets/...
  W-->>B: static asset
```

The request-time build happens in the proc worker that received the request.
The actual npm/vite command is a subprocess of that worker.

## Source-Edit Detection And Auto-Rebuild

For HTML-entrypoint requests, the static widget route consults a **signature
provider** before short-circuiting the in-process "already built" check. The
provider is the workflow's `compute_ui_widget_signature(alias)` (or
`compute_ui_main_view_signature()` for main-view), which walks the source
tree and computes the same `kind|src|build_command|bundle_id|<source-
fingerprint>` string that `_ensure_static_ui_app_build` uses internally.

Behaviour at the in-process layer:

| Stored signature for `load_key` | Current signature from provider | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing | Any value | Fall through, install build task |
| Equal to current | Equal | Short-circuit (fast string equality, no source walk inside the lock) |
| Different from current | Different | Drop stale entry, fall through, install fresh build task |
| Any | `None` (provider returned None or raised) | Legacy membership-based short-circuit (skip if `load_key` was ever marked done) |

The fingerprint walk runs **outside** the asyncio lock, so concurrent HTML
requests do not serialise on it. The on-disk lock + signature inside
`run_once_for_shared_bundle_storage` still arbitrates across workers — when
two HTML requests on different machines compute the same new signature, only
one actually rebuilds; the other observes "became current" and short-
circuits at the shared-storage layer.

Static-asset paths (`/widgets/<alias>/assets/*`) do **not** invoke the
signature provider — they hit the legacy zero-cost membership short-circuit.
Asset URLs are content-hashed by Vite, so a rebuild produces new filenames
and the new `index.html` references them; old asset URLs that no longer
exist return 404, which the browser handles via a page reload.

Practical effect: editing a file in the bundle's UI `src_folder` and then
hitting `index.html` causes the next request to rebuild — no manual
`kdcube bundle reload <bundle_id>` required for source edits. `kdcube bundle reload`
remains the supported escape hatch for invalidating other process-local
state (manifests, decorator caches, singleton workflows).

For Python source edits, descriptor-backed config changes, or a stale widget
entrypoint load, use the target bundle reload path. It evicts the bundle in
proc, invalidates static widget entrypoint load state, and broadcasts the
changed bundle id to other proc workers:

- [../../service/cicd/cli-README.md#bundle-reload-flow](../../service/cicd/cli-README.md#bundle-reload-flow)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser
  participant W as proc worker
  participant P as Workflow
  participant S as Shared storage

  B->>W: GET /widgets/x/index.html
  W->>P: compute_ui_widget_signature("x") -> "sig-A"
  W->>W: in-process _done[load_key] == "sig-A"?
  alt cached signature matches
    W-->>B: serve cached index.html (fast path)
  else cached signature missing or differs
    W->>P: _ensure_ui_build()
    P->>S: acquire op=ui-widget-x lock
    P->>S: write build output + signature
    W->>W: _done[load_key] = "sig-A"
    W-->>B: serve fresh index.html
  end
```

## Cancellation And Timeouts

Browser iframe requests can be canceled by:

- switching bundle selection
- closing the panel
- reloading the page
- navigating the iframe
- network/proxy timeout

The platform must not let a canceled browser request poison shared UI state.
The current static entrypoint loader shields the entrypoint load/build task from
request cancellation. This means:

- the original HTTP request may still fail or return a client-disconnect
  response
- the build task should continue inside the worker
- the shared-storage signature should be written when the build completes
- a later request should see a cache hit or "became current" instead of
  restarting the same build

Build subprocess timeout:

- each npm/vite subprocess is limited to 600 seconds
- timeout kills the subprocess
- no signature is written
- the lock is released in `finally`
- the next request/preload can attempt the build again

Shared-lock wait behavior:

- default wait is controlled by `BUNDLE_UI_BUILD_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS`, default
  `600`
- lock TTL is controlled by `BUNDLE_UI_BUILD_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS`, default `900`
- static UI builds do not serve stale output while locked unless the code
  explicitly opts into that mode

## Concurrency Rules

KDCube assumes concurrent proc workers and possibly concurrent tasks in future
deployments.

Correct behavior depends on these rules:

- every worker can import the authoritative bundle path
- every worker can discover the same decorators for the same bundle version
- every worker computes the same UI build signature for the same bundle version
- startup preload uses Redis app-generation claims so workers take different
  app preload items instead of all rebuilding the same item
- successful startup preload writes a generation-specific done marker so later
  workers skip the same completed app generation
- preload claims are heartbeat-renewed; if a worker dies, the claim expires and
  another worker can retry
- only one worker holds a given shared-storage build lock at a time
- waiting workers re-check the signature while waiting
- completed builds write a signature only after `index.html` exists
- final output is swapped atomically from a temporary output folder
- request cancellation does not cancel the shared build task

What is process-local:

- imported Python modules
- bundle singletons
- manifest cache
- process-local static entrypoint-load "done" map (load_key → captured
  source signature; see [Source-Edit Detection And Auto-Rebuild](#source-edit-detection-and-auto-rebuild))
- request state

What is shared:

- bundle registry authority
- managed bundle files
- bundle storage root
- built UI output
- UI signatures
- UI locks
- Redis/Postgres-backed platform state

## Main View Versus Widget Lifecycle

Main view and widgets use the same build machinery but different routes and
storage destinations.

| Surface | Config | Discovery | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main view | `ui.main_view` | bundle main-view route / main-view support | `<bundle_storage_root>/ui` |
| Widget | `ui.widgets.<alias>` | `@ui_widget(alias="<alias>")` | `<bundle_storage_root>/ui/widgets/<alias>` |

The main view can build successfully while a widget is still cold. A widget can
build successfully while the main view is absent. Do not use one as proof of
the other.

## Shared Sources Lifecycle

`shared_sources` are copied into the consuming bundle's temporary build source
tree before the widget build runs. The resulting static app is written to that
bundle's storage root and served as that bundle's widget alias.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  SDK["sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories"]
  Temp[".ui.src.tmp.../_shared/memory-widget"]
  Vite["Vite alias @kdcube/memory-widget"]
  Bundle["single built widget app"]

  SDK --> Temp
  Temp --> Vite
  Vite --> Bundle
```

Rules:

- `sdk://...` resolves under the installed SDK package.
- `bundle://...` resolves under the bundle root.
- relative paths resolve under the bundle root.
- source-folder absolute paths are for direct local testing only. They are not
  storage roots and should not be used in reusable descriptors.
- copied shared source is part of the build signature.
- shared source must not be edited in the temporary folder.
- each consuming bundle has its own built widget artifact and signature.

If a widget import fails with a missing SDK UI path, check `shared_sources`
first. Do not patch the temporary source directory.

## Logs To Read

UI build logs are emitted by the bundle entrypoint logger with `[bundle.ui]`.
Startup preload coordination logs are emitted by the proc service with
`[Bundles]`.

Important lines:

```text
[Bundles] Collaborative preload already active; joining work scan: ...
[Bundles] Preload skip (bundle claimed by another worker): id=...
[Bundles] Preload skip (generation already done): id=...
[Bundles] Preload start: id=... owner={'instance_id': ..., 'pid': ..., 'generation': ...}
[Bundles] Preload succeeded: id=... duration_ms=...
[bundle.ui] lock acquired op=ui-widget-<alias> storage=...
[bundle.ui] waiting for lock op=ui-widget-<alias> ... owner=host=...,pid=...
[bundle.ui] widget:<alias> materialized shared source ...
[bundle.ui] widget:<alias> build start: src=... build_src=... dest=...
[bundle.ui] widget:<alias> build command: npm install ...
[bundle.ui] widget:<alias> build command: vite build
[bundle.ui] widget:<alias> build done: dest=... index_html=True
[bundle.ui] done: op=ui-widget-<alias> storage=...
[bundle.ui] skipped: signature cache hit op=ui-widget-<alias> storage=...
[bundle.ui] skipped: became current op=ui-widget-<alias> storage=...
[bundle.ui] widget:<alias> build failed: ...
```

For ECS CloudWatch:

```bash
aws logs filter-log-events --region eu-west-1 \
  --log-group-name /kdcube/demo/demo-march/chat-proc \
  --start-time <epoch_ms> \
  --end-time <epoch_ms> \
  --filter-pattern "telegram_miniapp build" \
  --query 'events[].{ts:timestamp,msg:message}' \
  --output json
```

Useful filters:

- `<alias> build`
- `<alias> done`
- `<alias> failed`
- `ui-widget-<alias>`
- `waiting for lock`
- `Request ended without response`

## Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Widget icon does not appear | `@ui_widget` missing, visibility hides it, bundle disabled, or listing did not see effective props | Manifest widgets, `enabled.widget.<alias>`, roles/user types |
| Widget icon appears but route says undefined widget | Serving worker did not discover `@ui_widget(alias)` for that bundle path/version | Manifest validation logs, worker PID headers, bundle path |
| Widget route says not available | `enabled.widget.<alias>` resolves false | Effective props after defaults + descriptor |
| Telegram Mini App says widget is unavailable | BotFather URL uses `/widgets/...` or widget visibility excludes the public/anonymous static-route session | Use `/public/widgets/<alias>/`; check `visibility.widget.<alias>` roles/user types |
| Widget route returns method-rendered payload instead of static app | `ui.widgets.<alias>` missing/disabled | Effective `ui.widgets` |
| Static widget iframe is blank | Built `index.html` references root-relative assets | Vite `base: './'`, browser asset URLs |
| Build repeats across workers | Signature not written, request cancellation before shielded build, stale lock, or differing signatures | `[bundle.ui] done`, `.ui.widgets/<alias>.signature`, lock owner logs |
| Source edit not picked up on next HTML hit | Signature provider returned `None` (config disabled / src_folder missing) — falls back to legacy short-circuit | Workflow's `compute_ui_widget_signature(alias)` value, `ui.widgets.<alias>` props, log line "[bundle.ui] widget:<alias> build skipped" |
| Source edit picked up on HTML hit but assets 404 | Browser cached old `index.html` referencing pre-rebuild asset hashes | Hard-reload the iframe; new `index.html` references new content-hashed assets |
| One worker fails and another succeeds | Process-local manifest/cache/preload mismatch or request cancellation | `X-KDCube-Worker-Pid`, manifest validation logs |
| Request returns client-disconnect wrapper | Browser/proxy canceled while route was loading/building | Compare request time with `[bundle.ui] build start/done` |

## Author Checklist

Before shipping a source-folder widget:

- add `@ui_widget(alias="<alias>")` to the bundle method
- add `@api(route="operations", alias="<alias>_widget")` only if the method
  also needs to be callable as an operation
- put stable `ui.widgets.<alias>` wiring in bundle defaults
- enable the widget in deployment descriptor or bundle defaults
- for Telegram/public launchers, use the `/public/widgets/<alias>/` URL and
  leave widget visibility compatible with the public/anonymous static session
- include every imported SDK UI source in `shared_sources`
- set Vite `base: './'`
- make `build.outDir` read `process.env.OUTDIR`
- avoid hardcoded tenant/project/bundle ids in widget source
- request runtime config with `CONFIG_REQUEST`
- accept both `CONFIG_RESPONSE` and `CONN_RESPONSE`
- call backend operations through the runtime-provided KDCube base URL and auth
- check logs for `build done` and `done: op=ui-widget-<alias>`
