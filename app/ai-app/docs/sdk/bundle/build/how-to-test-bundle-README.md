# How To Test A KDCube Bundle

This document is the operational test playbook for bundle builders.

If you are still deciding what to read first, start with
[how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md](how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md).

Tier 1 rule:

- this page is one part of the Tier 1 pack
- do not treat it as sufficient on its own
- read it together with the Tier 1 authoring, configuration, and configure/run pages

The goal is not “run something once”.
The goal is to prove that the bundle works in the supported KDCube runtime contract.

Use this together with:

- [how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md](how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md)
- [how-to-write-bundle-README.md](how-to-write-bundle-README.md)
- [how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md](how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md)
- [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)
- [how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md](how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md)
- [versatile-reference-bundle-README.md](../versatile-reference-bundle-README.md)
- [bundle-widget-integration-README.md](../bundle-widget-integration-README.md)
- [bundle-runtime-README.md](../bundle-runtime-README.md)
- [bundle-delivery-and-update-README.md](../bundle-delivery-and-update-README.md)

Tier 1 role of this page:

- use it after you have bundle code and a real runtime
- use it to validate wrappers around existing user code, not only greenfield bundles
- use it to prove the full KDCube contract, not only unit-level correctness
- use it as the primary page for both local QA and integration QA

## 0. Which QA Job Are You Doing

There are two different QA jobs and this page covers both.

### Local QA

This means:

- syntax and import checks
- shared bundle suite
- bundle-local pytest
- direct checks of helpers, serializers, cron bodies, and builders

### Integration QA

This means:

- bundle discovery in a real KDCube runtime
- reload behavior after descriptor or code changes
- browser/widget validation
- API and MCP validation
- cron/runtime-path validation inside the real environment

Use the same document for both, but do not confuse them.
Passing local tests is necessary and still not enough.

## 1. Testing Order

All commands in this page assume the working environment in
[1A. Working Environment For Agents](#1a-working-environment-for-agents).

Run tests in this order:

1. syntax/import checks
2. shared SDK bundle suite
3. bundle-local pytest tests
4. isolated direct checks for generated HTML/builders if applicable
5. local runtime reload path
6. real widget/API/manual runtime checks

After validation passes, use
[how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md](how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md)
only if the user agrees to cut a content release, tag it, push it, or update a
git-backed descriptor ref.

Do not jump straight to browser/manual testing.
That is the slowest feedback loop and the weakest signal.

Runtime-shape rule:

- if the runtime itself may be misconfigured, fix `assembly.yaml`, `bundles.yaml`, and `bundles.secrets.yaml` first
- use [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md) for the exact local runtime contract before debugging widget/API behavior

## 1A. Working Environment For Agents

Before touching bundle code, prove the test environment.

Use this baseline unless the task gives a different active runtime:

```bash
cd /abs/path/to/kdcube-ai-app
PY=app/venvs/ai-app/chat-processor/bin/python
```

If that interpreter does not exist, use the project venv for the runtime you are
testing. Do not use bare `python3` or bare `pytest` until you have proven they
point to the same environment.

Readiness checks:

```bash
$PY -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
$PY -m pytest --version
$PY -m pip show pytest-asyncio
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
  $PY -m pytest -q \
  app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/tests/test_singleton_request_context.py::test_singleton_entrypoint_keeps_comm_context_task_local
```

Interpretation:

- `pytest-asyncio` is required for tests that use `pytest.mark.asyncio`
- if it is missing, fix the venv/test dependencies before interpreting failures
- `PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app` is required unless the package is installed in the active venv
- shared bundle-suite tests require `--bundle-path` or `BUNDLE_UNDER_TEST`
- route/integration tests should create request objects with an ASGI `app` and `app.state.redis_async`, because production route code reads runtime state from `request.app.state`

First smoke commands:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
  $PY -m pytest -q \
  app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/tests/test_bundle_interfaces.py
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
  $PY -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tests.bundle.run_bundle_suite \
  --bundle-path /abs/path/to/bundle
```

## 1B. Skeleton-Stage Checks

For a brand-new bundle skeleton, prove the contract before adding product logic:

- the bundle has the skeleton files from
  [how-to-write-bundle-README.md#1b1-new-bundle-skeleton-checklist](how-to-write-bundle-README.md#1b1-new-bundle-skeleton-checklist)
- `entrypoint.py` parses/imports in the project venv
- `config/bundles.template.yaml` makes clear whether `path:` is a seed/source
  descriptor host path or a staged runtime/container path
- seed/source descriptors used by local CLI setup or IntelliJ/proc host runs
  use host-visible bundle paths
- deployment-scoped secrets are documented in `config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml`
- user-owned secrets, such as a user's personal email credentials, are not in
  descriptor templates
- `docs/design/` and `docs/journal/journal.md` exist and are updated with the
  first implementation decisions

Do this before building UI, tools, or scheduler logic. A clean skeleton makes
later failures narrower.

## 1B.1 Reusable SDK Block Checks

When the bundle uses SDK integrations or solutions, test the bundle binding
instead of duplicating the SDK package tests.

Check that:

- `entrypoint.py` configures the SDK module with the intended storage root,
  target user resolver, bundle id, role policy, or widget modules;
- operations/public route tests prove the right auth boundary, for example
  KDCube auth, Telegram webhook secret, or Telegram Mini App `initData`;
- user-owned credentials use user-scoped secrets/state;
- deployment-owned provider settings use bundle props/secrets;
- design docs name the SDK blocks being used and describe what policy remains
  in the bundle;
- package-level SDK tests cover the reusable mechanics.

## 1C. React Tool/Skill Checks

Use [bundle-agent-integration-README.md](../bundle-agent-integration-README.md)
as the full contract for React descriptors, file-producing tools, MCP
connector/server wiring, and Claude Code subagent requirements.

For a React-backed bundle, prove the agent surface before manual testing:

- `entrypoint.py` instantiates the workflow in the same shape as
  `kdcube.copilot@2026-04-03-19-05`
- `orchestrator/workflow.py` calls `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`
- `tools_descriptor.py` exposes only the tool aliases the bundle actually needs
- `skills_descriptor.py` points to bundle-local skills
- `skills_descriptor.py` / `job_skills_descriptor.py` visibility filters use
  the real React decision ids `solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong` and
  `solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular`
- each skill has `SKILL.md`
- each skill `tools.yaml` references real tool ids from `tools_descriptor.py`
- distinct product concepts have distinct tool aliases
- stateful skill `when_to_use` rules clearly separate retrieval from
  write/reconcile scenarios
- tool descriptions tell the agent when to search, comment/update, create, or
  leave the state untouched
- public webhooks or operations APIs stay thin and do not duplicate React tool
  business logic

Good React smoke tests:

- descriptor aliases match expected domain names, for example `tasks` and
  `user_memory`
- bundle-local storage tests prove each domain writes to its own storage area
- durable asset tests prove each task/memory is stored as one source-of-truth
  file and any SQLite index is rebuildable
- memory tests prove user-visible policy metadata is present and widget-open
  read receipts mark only returned visible entries/comments as seen
- task tests prove search can find existing tasks before edit/delete/link
  operations and task relations/conversation ids are persisted
- a webhook test proves the public endpoint is exposed and authenticated
- transport tests prove Telegram or other adapters render/send from the turn
  result or timeline rather than duplicating task/memory logic
- public webhook tests cover duplicate delivery of the same provider event id,
  for example Telegram `update_id`, and prove the bundle acknowledges the
  duplicate without running the React turn again
- attachment transport tests cover both captioned and attachment-only messages;
  provider file ids must be hydrated into normal bundle attachments before the
  React turn starts
- a runtime test or manual check proves the webhook triggers the React turn when
  the bundle is loaded in proc
- user-scope tests prove that state and user secrets are keyed by the resolved
  bundle user scope, not by an assumed KDCube account id
- if the bundle has public/external users, test both the KDCube-authenticated
  path and the public integration path, for example Telegram `initData`
  verification plus mapping/fallback to a stable external user scope
- tool-signature tests verify the model is not asked to invent runtime ids such
  as user id, task id, execution id, conversation id, internal account id, or
  storage paths; those must come from runtime context, job payload, or opaque
  references returned by earlier tools
- tool-description tests or direct signature checks verify model-facing return
  annotations include the timeline-visible `ret` shape, not only the envelope.
  For example, assert the annotation contains fields such as
  `ret={accounts:[...]}` or `ret={messages:[...],claude_code_mcp?...}` when the
  solver must use those fields in later steps.
- file-producing tool tests verify the strict result envelope:
  `{"ok": true, "ret": {"artifact_type": "files", "files": [...]}}`
- if a trusted bundle/catalog tool uses `host_files(...)`, tests or manual
  runtime checks verify hosted file rows include hosted metadata such as
  `hosted_uri`, `rn`, or `key`
- `host_files(...)` checks should run in a prepared tool context with
  `ToolSubsystem.hosting_service`, tenant, project, user id, conversation id,
  turn id, conversation storage, and output directory. The normal path is
  `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`; the isolated path is `bootstrap_bind_all(...)`.
- if generated executor code needs files, tests cover the scenario where it
  calls a catalog tool through `agent_io_tools.tool_call(...)` rather than
  trying to host files directly
- if the tool may run in isolated runtime, include an isolated-runtime check
  that proves the reconstructed tool subsystem can still host or return files

Do not add a gate-agent test unless the bundle intentionally has a gate.
For simple React bundles, a deterministic prepare step plus solver is enough.

## 1D. Runtime Log And Timeline Checks

When a manual SSE, webhook, widget, cron, or `@on_job` test fails, inspect
runtime logs and the turn timeline before changing bundle code. The final bot
answer is evidence, but it can be misleading if a tool returned the wrong
diagnostic.

Find the active log directory from the runtime descriptor or assembly. For local
development it is usually under the dev workspace:

```bash
LOG_DIR="${KDCUBE_DEV_WORKSPACE:-$HOME/.kdcube/dev-workspace}/log"
rg -n "<bundle-id>|<tool-id>|bundle.on_load|allowed_plugins|tool_ids|tool_runtime_not_bound|on_job" "$LOG_DIR"
```

Replace `<bundle-id>` and `<tool-id>` with the failing bundle and tool aliases.

Prove the sequence:

- proc actually restarted after platform or descriptor changes
- the bundle resolver found the expected path, git ref, and module
- `on_bundle_load` ran successfully for the bundle
- React was built with the expected `allowed_plugins` and `tool_ids`
- skill loading exposed the expected bundle-local skills
- skill visibility was filtered with the actual decision agent id shown in logs
  and accounting, not a legacy descriptor key
- the requested tool actually executed, not only appeared in the catalog
- the tool result block contains the `ret` fields promised by the model-facing
  tool return annotation
- the resolved bundle user scope and user type match the path being tested
  (KDCube-authenticated, Telegram/public, cron, or `@on_job`)
- `bundle_call_context` or job payload contains expected runtime ids for job
  tools instead of those ids being supplied by the model
- the turn timeline contains the events needed by the transport adapter

Classify failures by boundary:

- bundle absent, operation absent, or widget absent: descriptor, import, or
  decorator discovery failure
- tool missing from `tool_ids`: `tools_descriptor.py`, alias, skill visibility,
  or React configuration failure
- tool present but `tool_runtime_not_bound` or "tools are not bound": platform
  or bundle runtime binding failure, not a user OAuth/configuration failure
- explicit account/config errors such as "account not connected" or "account not
  found": user-actionable setup failure
- webhook returns only an acknowledgement: check the timeline and outbound
  transport rendering path, because webhook JSON is usually not the bot reply
- same old user request repeats after a webhook retry: check event-id
  idempotency before checking React behavior
- attachment message gets no answer: check whether attachment-only messages are
  dropped before React and whether provider file ids are converted to readable
  bundle attachments

Multiworker rule:

- check logs across all proc workers
- a bundle may load in one process while the failing request is served by another
- after platform code changes, restart proc; a new conversation is not enough

Close the loop:

- keep small, targeted runtime logs for surfaces that are hard to classify, such
  as `allowed_plugins`, `tool_ids`, resolved bundle path, and job metadata
- add a regression test at the boundary that failed
- do not replace an internal runtime error with user setup advice

## 1.1 What This Test Guide Must Prove

Testing is not only about “does one function work”.

For a bundle, the test set should prove all of these:

- the bundle loads and its manifest is discoverable
- the expected surfaces appear:
  - APIs
  - widgets
  - MCP endpoints
  - scheduled jobs
- each runtime path behaves correctly:
  - request-bound entrypoint path
  - operations/public HTTP path
  - cron/system path
  - isolated path when relevant
- config and secrets are read from the supported runtime contract
- mutable state goes to the correct storage tier
- reload/reconcile behavior works after descriptor changes

## 2. Baseline Test Matrix

Every non-trivial bundle should be tested at these layers.

### 2.1 Quick commands by feature

Use these as the first actionable checks for each bundle surface.

### Syntax and imports

```bash
$PY -m py_compile /abs/path/to/bundle/entrypoint.py
```

For bundles that may be delivered from git or from a repo parent directory,
also prove both loader import shapes:

```bash
BUNDLE_PARENT=/abs/path/to/repo/src
BUNDLE_PACKAGE=my_bundle
BUNDLE_DIR=$BUNDLE_PARENT/$BUNDLE_PACKAGE
```

Set `BUNDLE_PACKAGE` to the Python import path used in the descriptor
`module`, without `.entrypoint`.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app:$BUNDLE_PARENT \
  $PY -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('${BUNDLE_PACKAGE}.entrypoint')"
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app:$BUNDLE_DIR \
  $PY -c "import importlib; importlib.import_module('entrypoint')"
```

If the bundle has nested tool modules, import those too. This catches
bundle-local imports that only work with one descriptor shape.

### Shared bundle contract

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
$PY -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tests.bundle.run_bundle_suite \
  --bundle-path /abs/path/to/bundle
```

### Bundle-local tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
$PY -m pytest -q /abs/path/to/bundle/tests
```

### Authenticated API

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5173/api/integrations/bundles/<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>/operations/task-board-api" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{"operation":"list","payload":{}}}'
```

### Public API with `header_secret`

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5173/api/integrations/bundles/<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>/public/incoming_webhook" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Secret: <shared-secret>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"ping"}'
```

### Public API with bundle-owned auth

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5173/api/integrations/bundles/<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>/public/telegram_webhook" \
  -H "X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token: <shared-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"update_id":1}'
```

### Public MCP

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5173/api/integrations/bundles/<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>/public/mcp/docs_public" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"tools/list"}'
```

### Bundle-authenticated MCP

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:5173/api/integrations/bundles/<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>/mcp/docs" \
  -H "X-Docs-MCP-Token: <shared-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"tools/list"}'
```

### Widget path sanity check

Open the widget, then verify in browser networking that it calls:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/operations/{alias}
```

If you see `////operations/...`, the widget is not correctly wired.

### Cron logic

Expose the cron body through a helper and test it directly:

```python
@cron(alias="sync", expr_config="task_tracker.sync", span="system")
async def sync(self, **kwargs):
    await self._sync_impl()
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app $PY -m pytest -q /abs/path/to/bundle/tests -k sync
```

Reference map:
- [bundle-platform-integration-README.md](../bundle-platform-integration-README.md)
- [bundle-widget-integration-README.md](../bundle-widget-integration-README.md)
- [bundle-transports-README.md](../bundle-transports-README.md)
- [bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md](../bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md)

### A. Import and syntax layer

Verify that the bundle files can load.

Typical command:

```bash
$PY -m py_compile /abs/path/to/bundle/entrypoint.py
```

If the bundle includes helper modules that build complex HTML/JS strings inside Python:

- compile those files too
- then execute the HTML-builder functions directly

Why:

- `py_compile` catches syntax errors
- direct execution catches runtime f-string/template mistakes that compile cleanly but crash later

### B. Shared SDK bundle suite

Run the shared SDK bundle suite against the bundle.

Command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
$PY -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tests.bundle.run_bundle_suite \
  --bundle-path /abs/path/to/bundle
```

This suite validates the shared bundle contract.

Use it for every bundle, not only for reference bundles.

### C. Bundle-local pytest tests

If the bundle has `tests/`, run them too.

Command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
$PY -m pytest -q /abs/path/to/bundle/tests
```

Write bundle-local tests for:

- bundle-specific transforms
- storage helpers
- business logic
- serialization and validation code
- widget data shaping

Do not rely only on the shared suite for bundle-specific behavior.

### D. Runtime integration checks

After unit/shared tests pass:

- load or reload the bundle in KDCube
- inspect widget/API discovery
- call operations through the real integrations routes
- verify actual runtime storage and mutation behavior

If the bundle shells out to git or other subprocesses that need credentials, also verify the process-boundary behavior:

- the subprocess receives the expected per-call env
- the processor process env is not being rewritten by the bundle
- inherited processor `GIT_*` variables, if present, are understood to be shared across apps by design

## 3. Runtime Surface Checks

Do not treat all runtime paths as equivalent.
They are not.

### A. Chat turn / SSE / socket path

Verify that request-bound logic behaves correctly when the bundle is entered through the normal processor path.

What to validate:

- request-bound code sees the expected `self.comm` / `self.comm_context`
- streaming or communicator-driven behavior works when the request is peer/session-bound
- actor-derived behavior is only exercised in this path, not assumed globally

### B. REST bundle operation path

Verify that request-bound bundle operations behave correctly through `/api/integrations/bundles/.../operations/...`.

What to validate:

- request-bound `self.comm` / `self.comm_context` are usable
- operation body parsing works with the expected payload shape
- widget-triggered operations are treated as request-bound entrypoint calls, not as detached background jobs

### C. Cron / scheduled-job path

Cron must be tested as a separate class of runtime.

What to validate:

- cron logic does not assume a real end-user actor
- cron logic does not depend on session/socket/request-header state
- cron code works with bundle props, storage, DB/Redis, and explicit scope only

If a bundle has `@cron(...)`, you should test at least one run path that invokes the scheduled logic directly.

### D. Isolated runtime path

If the bundle or its tools may execute in isolated runtime, test that path explicitly.

What to validate:

- code does not depend on arbitrary host-process globals

## 4. Git-Backed Bundle Checks

If the bundle manages git workspaces, session stores, or external repos, test the git auth boundary explicitly.

Validate all of these:

- git remote normalization works as expected for your configured transport
- descriptor-backed token or SSH settings are visible to the git subprocess
- explicit call-site overrides affect only that subprocess invocation
- the bundle does not mutate processor `os.environ` in order to make git work

Minimal check pattern:

```python
env = build_git_env(
    git_http_token=get_secret("services.git.http_token"),
    git_http_user=get_secret("services.git.http_user"),
)
subprocess.run(["git", "config", "--get", "remote.origin.url"], env=env, check=True)
```

What the result should mean:

- inherited processor env is shared by design
- the bundle’s explicit subprocess env is local to that git command
- one bundle’s git override must not become another bundle’s process-global mutation
- only documented portable runtime bindings are assumed
- isolated execution gets the inputs it actually needs

Do not accept “works in process” as proof that isolated execution is correct.

### E. Singleton path

If the bundle is configured as singleton, test that explicitly too.

What to validate:

- the bundle reuses the cached instance as intended
- request-bound behavior still reads the current context correctly
- request state is not accidentally retained across calls

The question to answer is:

- “does singleton reuse break request correctness?”

not:

- “did singleton exist?”

### F. Exclusivity path

If the bundle has operations that must not overlap, test the exclusivity mechanism directly.

For cron:

- verify the selected `span` matches the intended exclusivity scope
- verify the job does not overlap inside the chosen scope

For non-cron operations:

- verify the explicit lock path, not just the happy-path operation result

Do not treat singleton configuration as proof of exclusivity.

## 4. Shared Suite Details

The shared suite runner is:

`src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/tests/bundle/run_bundle_suite.py`

It expects:

- a bundle directory
- that directory must contain `entrypoint.py`

Useful variants:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
$PY -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tests.bundle.run_bundle_suite \
  --bundle-path /abs/path/to/bundle \
  --shared-only
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app \
$PY -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tests.bundle.run_bundle_suite \
  --bundle-path /abs/path/to/bundle \
  --bundle-only
```

Use `--shared-only` when you want fast contract feedback.
Use `--bundle-only` when you are iterating on bundle-specific tests.

## 5. What Bundle-Local Tests Should Cover

Bundle-local tests should cover the parts that the platform cannot know.

Typical targets:

- local storage path resolution
- content normalization
- markdown/html transforms
- API payload shaping
- admin operation behavior
- index/document generation
- workflow helper logic
- storage round-trips
- bundle-local report export logic

Use the `versatile` tests as the model:

`src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/versatile@2026-03-31-13-36/tests/test_preferences_canvas.py`

That test file is useful because it checks:

- bundle-local storage-backed behavior
- import/load paths
- data transforms
- export/import round-trips

That is the right style.
Test the bundle’s concrete behavior, not just that functions exist.

## 6. Widget Testing Rules

Widget testing has two layers:

1. source/build or static/widget-generation correctness
2. runtime display integration correctness

### 5.1 Widget source/build correctness

For new React widgets, prefer a source folder declared in bundle config:

```yaml
ui:
  web_app_widgets:
    task_memo_webapp:
      enabled: true
      src_folder: widgets/task_memo_webapp
      build_command: npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build
```

Local source checks:

```bash
cd /abs/path/to/bundle/widgets/task_memo_webapp
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Runtime checks:

- open `/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/widgets/{alias}`
- open `/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/widgets/{alias}/{subpath}`
- confirm the source folder is built into shared bundle storage and subpaths
  fall back to the built `index.html`
- edit widget source and verify the bundle UI loader refreshes the built files
  from source signature changes

If the widget commits a lockfile, prefer `npm ci` in the build command. If it
does not, use `npm install --no-package-lock` so loader builds do not create
source-tree churn.

### 5.1A Legacy widget generation correctness

If the widget HTML is generated from Python:

- execute the builder function directly
- do not stop at `py_compile`

This catches issues like:

- unescaped braces in Python f-strings
- malformed embedded CSS
- malformed embedded JS template literals

Example failure mode:

- CSS like `@page{size:auto}` inside a Python f-string can raise `NameError`
- JS template literals with `${...}` can also break if braces are not escaped

Rule:

- if Python renders a React/TSX widget into HTML, directly evaluate the widget method before runtime testing

### 5.2 Widget UI runtime contract

A widget is not tested until you verify the runtime display contract.

Check:

- widget requests config from parent
- widget accepts both `CONN_RESPONSE` and `CONFIG_RESPONSE`
- widget builds operation URLs from runtime config
- widget uses `defaultAppBundleId`, not a source-folder guess
- widget uses host-provided auth headers
- widget unwraps the `[alias]` field from integrations responses
- if the widget is one web app with internal routes, direct widget subpaths
  return HTML and pass `widget_path` / `path` to the widget method

Manual test:

- open the widget
- inspect browser networking
- confirm operation path is:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/operations/{alias}
```

For a single-widget web app, also open:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/widgets/{widget_alias}/{subpath}
```

It should return the same React widget shell with the requested panel/route
selected.

For a source-folder widget intended for a Telegram Mini App, also open:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/public/widgets/{widget_alias}/{subpath}
```

That should load the same static shell without platform login. Then verify the
widget's public data/action calls separately with the bundle's own auth
mechanism, such as signed Telegram `initData`.

If you see:

- missing tenant/project/bundle id
- `////operations/...`
- source-folder name instead of runtime bundle id

the widget is not integrated correctly.

### 5.2A Browser-tool verification

When an agent needs to prove generated HTML or widget behavior in a real browser,
use the ReAct `browser_tools` namespace rather than guessing from static code.

Use it for:

- generated standalone HTML apps
- widget navigation and button/click behavior
- form filling and operation-path smoke checks
- below-the-fold content and scroll-dependent UI state
- screenshot-backed visual checks when DOM/text status is not enough

Do not overuse screenshots. They are useful for visual state, layout, canvas, or
image checks, but they add multimodal payload cost. Prefer DOM/text status after
ordinary clicks, fills, scrolls, and status checks when that is enough.

Important runtime boundary:

- `browser_tools` runs in the ReAct tool runtime and keeps a per-turn browser
  session
- isolated exec code may use Playwright independently if the runtime image
  supports it, but it does not share the ReAct `browser_tools` session
- turn completion, managed errors, watchdog timeout, and cancellation attempt
  browser-session cleanup through lifecycle finalizers

Primary docs:

- [Browser Tools](../../integrations/browser/browser-tools-README.md)
- [Playwright Backend](../../integrations/browser/playwright-README.md)

### 5.2B Source-folder widget build contract

For React/Vite widgets declared under `ui.web_app_widgets.<alias>`, test the
loader build contract as well as the browser behavior.

Descriptor shape:

```yaml
build_command: npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build
```

Widget source requirements:

- `package.json` script should be `vite build` or equivalent, without the
  loader output path as a positional argument
- Vite should use `build.outDir: process.env.OUTDIR || 'dist'`
- Vite should use relative assets such as `base: './'`

Local source check:

```bash
cd /abs/path/to/bundle/widgets/<widget_alias>
OUTDIR=/tmp/kdcube-widget-build npm run build
test -f /tmp/kdcube-widget-build/index.html
```

Runtime log check:

- expected: `build command: npm install ...`
- expected: `build command: tsc -b && vite build` or `build command: vite build`
- bad: `vite build /.../.ui.build.tmp...`

If you see:

```text
[UNRESOLVED_ENTRY] Cannot resolve entry module .../.ui.build.tmp.../index.html
```

then the output directory leaked into Vite as a project/root argument. Fix the
widget `package.json`/Vite `outDir` contract or update to a platform build
runner that treats `<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH>` as an environment value.

### 5.2C Custom main-view UI contract

For bundles with `ui.main_view` / `ui-src`, test the bundle main UI as a
runtime surface, not as a standalone website.

Local source checks:

```bash
cd /abs/path/to/bundle/ui-src
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Runtime checks:

- edit `ui-src`, not the built runtime storage directory
- do not run `OUTDIR=<bundle_storage_root>/ui npm run build` as the fix
- request the custom UI HTML through `/api/integrations/static/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}`
- verify the bundle UI loader refreshes the built files when the source signature changed
- verify the bundle UI receives `baseUrl`, tenant, project, auth headers, `streamId`, and `defaultAppBundleId` from the runtime config bridge
- use `defaultAppBundleId` for `/sse/chat`, `/api`, `/mcp`, and widget calls
- for a new `/sse/chat` conversation, omit `conversation_id`; bind the server-generated id from the ack or first SSE envelope

Failure signals:

- `sse/chat failed (404) {"detail":"Conversation not found"}` usually means the UI sent a local fake `conversation_id` for a new conversation
- `Unknown bundle_id ...` usually means the bundle UI used a baked/source id or the runtime registry does not include the selected bundle
- a stale hashed JS asset after source changes means the loader/static route path must be checked, not manually bypassed

### 5.3 Read-only load check

A bundle widget should usually be read-only on initial load.

Verify:

- simply opening the widget does not trigger unwanted mutation
- explicit read-receipt widgets, such as a memory widget, mutate only the
  documented seen/acknowledged fields for returned visible items
- sync, push, rebuild, or run-now paths happen only on explicit user action

This is especially important for:

- archive sync widgets
- admin widgets
- pipeline dashboards

## 7. API Testing Rules

For every decorated API surface, verify both discovery and invocation.

Check:

- the bundle appears in the integrations listing
- the expected `apis` and `widgets` entries are present
- the operation is callable through the correct alias

Important:

- if a bundle import fails, the bundle may appear partially but with missing APIs/widgets
- if manifest discovery looks wrong, check import errors first

For POST operations, widget clients should send:

```json
{ "data": { ... } }
```

The integrations layer also accepts raw JSON objects, but widgets should use the platform wrapper.

## 8. Access-Control Testing

You must test visibility and invocation for the declared access model.

Current user-type ordering:

- `anonymous < registered < paid < privileged`

Test that:

- `registered` widgets/apis are visible to `registered`, `paid`, `privileged`
- `paid` widgets/apis are visible to `paid`, `privileged`
- `privileged` widgets/apis are visible only to `privileged`

If `roles=(...)` is also declared:

- test both with and without the role

For admin widgets/apis:

- verify no-permission behavior is explicit and clean
- verify the privileged path works through the real UI/API

## 9. Storage Testing

Bundles usually touch more than one storage tier.
Test the correct one.

### Local bundle storage

If the bundle keeps mutable local state, verify it is created under the platform-managed bundle storage root, not under the source tree.

Check:

- local workspaces
- cloned repos
- generated caches
- archive mirrors

Expected rule:

- instance-local mutable state belongs under bundle local storage

### Descriptor-backed props

If the bundle updates deployment-scoped config, verify:

- the write goes through bundle props
- the change lands in the expected descriptor-backed path
- reload respects it

### Artifact storage

If the bundle uses `AIBundleStorage`, verify:

- the correct artifact path is written
- local working state is not incorrectly stored there

## 10. Runtime Reload And Local Development Loop

If you are testing a locally mounted bundle, verify the actual reload path.

Typical loop:

```bash
kdcube --descriptors-location <dir> --build
```

Then after code/descriptor changes:

```bash
kdcube reload <bundle_id> --workdir <runtime-workdir>
```

This is important because a bundle may pass tests but still fail during descriptor-driven runtime resolution.

Use reload testing after changing:

- bundle code
- `bundles.yaml`
- `bundles.secrets.yaml`

For generated custom main-view UI, also test the loader boundary:

- source lives in the bundle `ui-src`
- runtime serves built files from bundle storage
- the bundle UI loader owns freshness checks and builds
- concurrent proc workers or shared EFS storage should result in one build and other workers seeing the completed signature/cache hit
- manual runtime-storage builds are diagnostic only, not the supported workflow

## 11. Standalone Helper Testing

If the bundle ships a standalone helper script, test it separately from runtime.

Typical rule:

- standalone mode is for local debug only
- operational runtime must still work through KDCube wiring

For standalone tests:

- load local `.env` into the platform settings path
- read config through `get_settings()` / `get_secret()`
- do not validate the bundle only through raw shell env behavior

You should test both:

- standalone path
- real bundle runtime path

If one works and the other does not, the feature is not done.

## 12. Failure Modes You Should Actively Probe

These are common enough that they should be tested deliberately.

### A. Descriptor identity mismatch

Test that runtime identity comes from descriptors/runtime context, not from the source folder name.

Symptoms:

- wrong storage root
- wrong workspace branch
- wrong session or conversation ID

### B. Missing widget config handshake

Symptoms:

- widget never loads data
- widget calls malformed routes
- widget has empty tenant/project/bundle id

### B2. Stale or wrong custom main-view UI

Symptoms:

- the browser still runs an old hashed asset after `ui-src` changed
- the bundle UI sends a baked bundle id instead of the selected runtime bundle id
- the bundle UI sends a local fake conversation id for a new SSE chat

Test by requesting the HTML entrypoint through the integrations static route and
checking browser networking for the actual `/sse/chat` payload.

### C. Import/manifest discovery failure

Symptoms:

- bundle listed without APIs/widgets
- 404 on expected operation alias

Cause is often:

- import error in entrypoint or imported modules

### D. Python f-string HTML builder failure

Symptoms:

- widget load crashes before response
- `NameError` from CSS or JS fragments inside Python string builder

Test by direct function execution.

### E. Read-only load unexpectedly mutates state

Symptoms:

- widget open triggers commits, pushes, syncs, or background jobs

### F. Wrong storage tier

Symptoms:

- local operational state written next to the source tree
- artifacts mixed with live workspace state

### G. Runtime config read from raw env instead of platform surfaces

Symptoms:

- feature works only in one shell session
- runtime ignores descriptors or bundle props

### H. Cron path assumes request-bound context

Symptoms:

- scheduled job crashes or behaves differently than the same logic behind a widget/API call

### I. Isolated path depends on host globals

Symptoms:

- helper works in one in-process test but fails when executed in isolated runtime

### J. Singleton reuse leaks request state

Symptoms:

- one request sees stale actor/session/request data from another request

### K. Singleton is mistaken for exclusivity

Symptoms:

- bundle is configured singleton but overlapping runs still happen
- state corruption still occurs under concurrency

## 13. Suggested Test Checklist Before Marking A Bundle Done

Before calling the bundle complete, verify all of these:

- `py_compile` passes for entrypoint and helper modules
- React/TSX widget render functions execute if the bundle renders widget HTML in Python
- shared SDK bundle suite passes
- bundle-local pytest tests pass
- bundle reload works through the local descriptor-driven flow
- bundle appears with correct APIs/widgets in integrations listing
- expected operations are callable through real routes
- widget networking uses the correct runtime URL shape
- custom main-view UI uses the runtime config bridge and selected runtime bundle id
- generated custom main-view UI is refreshed by the loader, not by manual runtime-storage builds
- generated HTML or widget click/form behavior is verified with browser tools
  when static checks are not enough
- widget respects auth/config handshake
- runtime identity matches descriptor identity
- local mutable state goes into bundle local storage
- descriptor-backed settings survive reload
- admin surfaces are permission-gated correctly
- singleton reuse does not leak request-bound state
- exclusivity behavior is validated separately from singleton behavior
- cron/system path does not assume request-bound comm context
- isolated-exec path does not assume host-process globals

## 14. Minimum Acceptance Standard

A bundle is not accepted just because:

- one method returns a value
- one widget renders once
- one manual operation succeeded

A bundle is accepted when:

- it passes shared and bundle-local tests
- it reloads correctly
- it follows the real platform widget/API contract
- it stores state in the correct tier
- it behaves correctly under the declared access model
- it survives the common failure modes listed above
