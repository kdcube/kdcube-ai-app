# How To Write A KDCube Bundle

This document is written for a builder agent or engineer who must create or maintain bundles in this repo.

It is not a conceptual overview.
It is the working instruction set for doing the job correctly.

Terminology note (rebrand in progress):

- in prose, a "bundle" is an "app (bundle)"; the two words mean the same thing
- technical identifiers stay verbatim during the rebrand: `bundle_id`,
  `bundles.yaml`, `@bundle_entrypoint`, `@bundle_id`

If you are not yet sure where this page fits in the full reading order, start
with [how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md](how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md).

If the product question is how a host website, host browser client, host
server, or backend-only app should integrate with KDCube, choose that shape in
[How To Integrate With KDCube Apps](../../../how-to-integrate-with-kdcube-apps-README.md)
before deciding whether the app needs widgets, operations, Data Bus handlers,
named services, chat events, or no UI at all.

If the app needs several browser surfaces to behave as one product workspace,
read [Scene Composition](../../solutions/scene/scene-composition-README.md)
early. Scene building is the frontend connection layer for the app ecosystem:
it mounts surfaces, relays runtime config, distributes namespace presentation,
routes context drag/drop, dispatches provider-declared object opens, and can
relay live events to subscribed widgets.

For the local runtime command lifecycle, use
[how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md#canonical-cli-flow-schemas](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md#canonical-cli-flow-schemas).
Bundle authors should know this split early: `init` creates the runtime,
`refresh` changes platform source/images, and `bundle reload` applies bundle
code/config changes.

Tier 1 rule:

- this page is one part of the Tier 1 pack
- do not treat it as sufficient on its own
- read it together with the Tier 1 test, configuration, and configure/run pages

Primary references:

- bundle docs under `docs/sdk/bundle/`
- the reference bundle:
  `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/workspace@2026-03-31-13-36`

## 1. Working Method

When you build a bundle, do not invent the platform contract from memory.

Work in this order:

1. read the test guide first so you know the runtime contract you must satisfy
2. read the SDK building-block map so you reuse existing integrations,
   solutions, tools, storage, widgets, and job helpers
3. read the relevant bundle docs
4. inspect the `workspace` reference bundle for the nearest working pattern
5. inspect the platform implementation only when docs/reference are not enough
6. then write the bundle
7. then run the shared bundle suite and bundle-local tests
8. then verify the actual UI/API runtime behavior

Practical rule:

- test expectations are part of requirements, not only post-build validation
- docs define the intended contract
- `workspace` shows the reference bundle shape
- platform source is the last resort for unresolved edge cases
- when live runtime behavior disagrees with tests or expectations, follow
  [how-to-test-bundle-README.md#1d-runtime-log-and-timeline-checks](how-to-test-bundle-README.md#1d-runtime-log-and-timeline-checks)
  before reading platform internals or changing product logic

Configuration/runtime rule:

- use this page for how to structure the bundle code
- use [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md) for `assembly.yaml`, `bundles.yaml`, `bundles.secrets.yaml`, `kdcube refresh --upstream --build`, and `kdcube info`

Common failure recipes:

- before editing bundle-local imports, widget networking, static assets,
  widget visibility, live progress events, Data Bus mutations, authored event
  policies, or resolver registration, read
  [how-to-avoid-common-bundle-integration-failures-README.md](how-to-avoid-common-bundle-integration-failures-README.md)
- before submitting or consuming conversation `external_events[]`, followups,
  steers, snapshots, ReAct event-source blocks, or story-aware UI events, read
  [how-to-understand-conversation-events-and-react-turns-README.md](how-to-understand-conversation-events-and-react-turns-README.md)
- before integrating memory, canvas, tasks, Telegram, delivery, or another
  reusable SDK subsystem, read
  [bundle-subsystem-integration-README.md](../bundle-subsystem-integration-README.md)

Shared widget rule:

- do not copy SDK-owned UI panels into every bundle
- if a bundle needs the User Memory widget or Telegram admin/channels panels
  inside its own webapp, configure `ui.widgets.<alias>.shared_sources`
  and import `@kdcube/memory-widget` or `@kdcube/telegram-widget`
- keep that source wiring in `configuration_defaults()` for built-in/reference
  bundles so descriptors can usually carry only deployment overrides
- keep product policy and authorization in bundle APIs; shared components are
  presentation code with injected operation callers
- when inheriting an SDK/base widget, use `enabled.widget.<alias>: false` to
  suppress the inherited surface, or configure `ui.widgets.<alias>` to serve
  your own built app for that inherited alias

Tier 1 role of this page:

- use it first when you are creating a new bundle
- use it first when you are wrapping existing user code into a bundle
- use it for creator and integrator work, not as the main configurator,
  deployer, or QA page
- do not use it as the main runtime setup guide or the main test guide

## 1A. What A Bundle Is

A KDCube bundle is a descriptor-addressed application unit that the platform
can discover, load, expose, and run through one or more surfaces.

In practical terms, a bundle is:

- code resolved from a bundle entry in `bundles.yaml`
- runtime metadata declared by decorators in `entrypoint.py`
- deployment-scoped non-secret config from bundle props
- deployment-scoped secret config from bundle secrets
- optional local mutable filesystem state under bundle storage
- optional remote state in platform or external storage systems

A bundle is not only a chat workflow.

It may expose one or more of these surfaces:

- on-message/chat handling
- authenticated operations APIs
- public APIs
- widgets
- bundle main UI apps
- MCP endpoints
- scheduled jobs
- authored external events for story-aware UI or service inputs

Operational rule:

- think of a bundle as a product module with a runtime contract
- descriptors decide how it is wired into the environment
- decorators decide what interfaces it exposes
- runtime context decides which execution path the code is in

Environment rule:

- one `tenant/project` runtime is one isolated environment
- use a different `tenant/project` when you need separate tenant data or
  separate stages such as `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`
- keep multiple bundles inside one `tenant/project` when they belong to the
  same environment

So a bundle is the end-to-end application unit inside an environment.
`tenant/project` is the environment boundary, not the bundle boundary.

## 1D. If You Are Wrapping Existing Code

Treat the existing application code and the bundle adapter as different layers.

Preferred structure:

- keep business logic, schemas, and external API adapters reusable
- keep KDCube-specific decorators and runtime calls close to `entrypoint.py`
- move deployment-scoped config into bundle props or bundle secrets
- move user-owned runtime state into user props or user secrets

Do not port the whole legacy application into one giant bundle class.

The bundle should be the KDCube-facing integration boundary, not the place where
all product logic becomes entangled with platform wiring.

### If the existing backend is Node or TypeScript

Use this split:

- Python bundle = public KDCube application shell
- Node or TS backend = internal backend of that bundle

Keep in Python:

- `@api(...)`
- `@mcp(...)`
- `@ui_widget(...)`
- `@data_bus_handler(...)`
- `@cron(...)`
- `@on_job`
- auth and roles
- props and secrets resolution

Keep in Node or TS:

- existing backend logic
- internal bridge routes
- optional live reconfigure handler

Use the public pattern, not a custom subprocess design:

- [bundle-node-backend-bridge-README.md](../bundle-node-backend-bridge-README.md)
- [node-backend-sidecar-README.md](../../node/node-backend-sidecar-README.md)

Builder rule:

- the Node backend is one implementation part of the bundle
- the bundle itself still belongs to Python from the platform point of view

## 1B. Bundle Lifecycle

When a bundle exists in a real environment, its lifecycle is:

1. A bundle entry in `bundles.yaml` identifies the code and supplies bundle props.
2. The platform resolves the bundle root/module and imports `entrypoint.py`.
3. Decorators are discovered and the bundle interface manifest is built.
4. The bundle becomes discoverable through integrations listing, subject to:
   - roles / user-types
   - bundle-level `enabled.bundle`
   - resource-level `enabled.{api,mcp,widget,cron}.<alias>`
5. The bundle is then entered through one of the runtime paths:
   - chat/on-message
   - operations/public API
   - widget-driven operation calls
   - MCP endpoint dispatch
   - Data Bus handler dispatch
   - cron/scheduled job
   - background job stream / `@on_job`
6. During execution, the bundle reads:
   - effective bundle props via `bundle_prop(...)`
   - secrets via async helpers such as `get_secret(...)` and
     `get_secret("u:...")`
   - typed platform settings via `get_settings()`
7. Mutable state goes to the right tier:
   - bundle local storage for instance-local filesystem state
   - `BundleArtifactStorage` for bundle artifacts
   - DB/Redis/external systems for runtime/business state
8. Config changes are applied by reload/reconcile:
   - `bundles.yaml` / `bundles.secrets.yaml` changes
   - bundle reload
   - scheduler reconciliation for cron jobs
9. If effective bundle props changed:
   - `on_props_changed(...)` may reconcile long-lived side effects
   - internal sidecars may restart or reconfigure lazily on next use
10. After a turn finishes, errors, or is cancelled:
   - `on_turn_completed(...)` may release per-turn resources
   - the hook is best-effort, timeout-bounded, and must be fast/idempotent

Builder rule:

- design the bundle around this lifecycle explicitly
- do not treat the code as if it only ever runs from one widget click path

Practical hook rule:

- `on_bundle_load(...)` = one-time per process per tenant/project setup
- `on_props_changed(...)` = reconcile long-lived state after effective prop change
- `pre_run_hook(...)` = request-time validation or lazy reconcile before execution
- `on_turn_completed(...)` = fast per-turn cleanup after success, error, or
  cancellation; do not perform expensive reporting or user-facing delivery there

Async rule:

- lifecycle hooks should be `async def`
- prefer `async def` for `@api`, `@mcp`, `@ui_widget`, `@data_bus_handler`,
  and `@cron` methods
- `@on_job` must be `async def`
- in bundle code, use awaited secret helpers:
  `get_secret(...)`, `get_secret("u:...")`,
  `set_user_secret(...)`, and `delete_user_secret(...)`
- do not run blocking setup in a request path
- if expensive work is only needed once for shared bundle storage, make it idempotent and guard it with a storage signature plus a cross-process lock

`BaseEntrypoint` hook inheritance rule:

- if the bundle entrypoint subclasses `BaseEntrypoint`,
  `BaseEntrypointWithMemory`, `BaseEntrypointWithEconomics`, or another
  platform entrypoint family class, an `on_bundle_load(...)` override must call
  `await super().on_bundle_load(**kwargs)` unless it deliberately replaces the
  platform UI build/prop-refresh contract
- apply runtime handles from `kwargs` first when your bundle needs them, then
  call `super()`, then run bundle-specific preparation
- missing `super()` is a startup-preload bug: the bundle can still load and
  scheduled jobs can still run, but source-folder widgets may only build when a
  user opens the widget

Shared-storage rule:

- `singleton` does not mean machine-global or EFS-global setup
- multiworker proc and ECS tasks can load the same bundle in multiple Python processes
- `on_bundle_load` may run once per process unless the work is explicitly guarded
- generated UI builds, indexes, and shared workspace preparation must tolerate concurrent loaders

## 1B.1 New Bundle Skeleton Checklist

When creating a new bundle from scratch, create the smallest useful skeleton
before implementing product behavior.

Recommended first-pass shape:

```text
<bundle-id>/
  README.md
  release.yaml
  entrypoint.py
  config/
    bundles.template.yaml
    bundles.secrets.template.yaml
  interface/
    README.md
  docs/
    design/
      <bundle-design>.md
    journal/
      journal.md
  tests/
```

Add only the implementation folders the first milestone needs, for example:

```text
  services/
  tools/
  events/
  ui/
    main/
    widgets/
  skills/
```

Skeleton file rules:

- `README.md` should have front matter with at least bundle id, title, summary,
  status, tags, module, singleton expectation, primary surfaces, and links to
  config/design/journal docs
- `release.yaml` may be empty until the first real release is cut
- when the user agrees to cut a release, fill `release.yaml` using
  [how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md](how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md)
- `entrypoint.py` should be loadable and thin, even if it only exposes a safe
  placeholder workflow/status API at first
- `config/bundles.template.yaml` documents non-secret deployment props
- `config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml` documents deployment-scoped bundle
  secrets only
- `interface/README.md` documents the bundle-visible contract: widget aliases,
  API/MCP/cron/job route aliases, public-auth rules, payload shapes, and the
  config keys that control them
- if the bundle has authored external events, `interface/README.md` documents
  `payload.target.agent_id`, `story_kind`, `story_id`, event-source ids,
  reactive flags, and artifact-ref namespaces the UI may send
- user-owned credentials and user state do not belong in descriptor templates
- `docs/design/` should contain the structured design that implementation will
  follow, not only raw notes
- `docs/journal/journal.md` should track important build decisions and
  bundle-builder-doc proposals while the bundle is being built
- update `docs/journal/journal.md` in the same change that alters runtime
  behavior, tool/skill contracts, storage semantics, user-scope mapping,
  release shape, or Tier 1 builder guidance
- if the bundle has source-folder main UI or widgets, the entrypoint class
  should inherit a concrete `BaseEntrypoint` family class unless it explicitly
  implements the same UI build contract; otherwise `ui.main_view` /
  `ui.widgets.<alias>.src_folder` can be present while no static artifacts are
  built or served. The family includes the bare base plus economics and memory
  variants; see [Bundle Entrypoint Classes](../bundle-entrypoint-classes-README.md)
- if the bundle has a chat/agent turn, semantic query embedding, task execution,
  or background job that spends quota/money, wire the appropriate economics
  surface from [Bundle Economics Integration](../bundle-economics-integration-README.md):
  `BaseEntrypointWithEconomics`, `search_model_service(flow=...)`, or
  `EconomicsGuard`
- when such an entrypoint overrides `on_bundle_load(...)`, preserve
  `await super().on_bundle_load(**kwargs)` so startup preload builds configured
  UI before live widget traffic
- do not decorate a `BaseWorkflow` subclass as the singleton bundle entrypoint.
  `BaseWorkflow` is the per-message orchestrator created inside the
  `BaseEntrypoint` turn execution.

### If the bundle has wizard, canvas, snapshot, or external artifact flows

Use this file split:

- workflow code passes event modules into ReAct through `event_source_specs`
  when the runtime needs event-only readers, policies, or rehosters
- `events/*.py` declares authored event sources, phase policy bindings, and
  artifact namespace rehosters
- `tools/*.py` keeps tool implementations; tool functions can add
  `@event_source(...)` when they need custom result handling
- bundle APIs save product/domain state and submit explicit events for agent
  context
- UI sends meaningful events with `agent_id`, `story_kind`, `story_id`,
  `event_source_id`, and compact artifact refs

Use `@artifact_namespace_rehoster(...)` when a snapshot, attachment, or domain
artifact is represented by an owner namespace such as `nmsp:...`, `mem:...`, or
`cnv:...`. The
rehoster chooses the ReAct destination by artifact meaning: snapshots under
`git/snapshots/`, editable workspace files under `git/projects/`, produced artifacts under
`files/`, and domain attachments under
`external/<event_kind>/attachments/<event_id>/...`.

If the bundle needs external human setup before an integration can work, add an
operator-facing integration homework doc such as:

```text
docs/integrations/admin-integrational-homework.md
```

Use that doc for actions outside code, for example creating Telegram bots,
collecting webhook secrets, or recording which descriptor/secrets keys must be
filled later. Do not use it for user-owned settings such as a user's personal
email credentials; those belong in the bundle UI/user settings flow.

Local path descriptor rule:

```yaml
bundles:
  version: "1"
  default_bundle_id: "my.bundle@1-0"
  items:
    - id: "my.bundle@1-0"
      name: "My Bundle"
      path: "/Users/you/src/my-repo/src/my.bundle@1-0"
      module: "entrypoint"
      singleton: false
      config: {}
```

For seed/source descriptors used by local CLI setup or host-side processor runs,
`path` is the host-visible bundle root. The CLI may rewrite the staged runtime
copy under `workdir/config/` to the container-visible mount path when the
processor runs inside Docker.

For the full local path contract, use
[how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md#local-path-bundles](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md#local-path-bundles).

### 1B.2 Bundle-Local Import Rule

Bundle code must load under both supported descriptor shapes:

```yaml
# bundle-root shape
subdir: "src/my_bundle"
module: "entrypoint"
```

```yaml
# parent-subdir shape
subdir: "src"
module: "my_bundle.entrypoint"
```

The same rule applies to local `path:` descriptors:

- `path: /Users/you/src/my-repo/src/my_bundle` with `module: entrypoint`
- `path: /Users/you/src/my-repo/src` with `module: my_bundle.entrypoint`

`module` is a Python import path. Dots in `module` are package separators, not
literal characters in a directory name. If the bundle directory name contains a
dot, prefer the bundle-root descriptor shape unless the filesystem layout
intentionally mirrors the dotted package path.

So bundle-local imports must be package-relative and must not depend on the
bundle root being the first `sys.path` entry.

In `entrypoint.py`, import bundle-local modules through the bundle package:

```python
from .subsystems.common import storage_root_or_error
from .services.storage import UserMemoryStorage
```

In nested bundle modules, use the matching relative form:

```python
from ..services.storage import UserMemoryStorage
from .helpers import normalize_payload
```

Import reusable SDK components by their real SDK package:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.automations import AsyncAutomationStorage
```

Do not add fallback top-level imports such as `from services...`,
`from apps...`, or `import tools` for bundle-local code. They can collide with
other bundles in the same processor process.

In particular, do not "guard" a relative import with a `try/except ImportError`
that falls back to a top-level import:

```python
# WRONG — the except branch is a top-level bundle-local import
try:
    from .services.storage import UserMemoryStorage
except ImportError:  # the comment usually claims "flat / top-level module load"
    from services.storage import UserMemoryStorage
```

A bundle is always loaded as a Python package, so the package-relative import
always resolves — there is no flat-load case to fall back to. Keep only the
relative import. The shared bundle suite check
`test_bundle_python_uses_package_relative_bundle_local_imports` rejects the
top-level import even when it is hidden inside an `except` branch, so this fails
at release validation. See
[how-to-avoid-common-bundle-integration-failures-README.md#recipe-bundle-local-python-imports](how-to-avoid-common-bundle-integration-failures-README.md#recipe-bundle-local-python-imports).

The same rule applies to tools. In `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools`,
declare bundle-local tools with file-based `ref` entries:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: user_memory
            kind: python
            ref: tools/user_memory_tools.py
            alias: user_memory
            allowed: [search_memo]
```

Inside `tools/user_memory_tools.py`, import same-bundle helpers through the
synthetic package context:

```python
from ..services.storage import UserMemoryStorage
```

Use `module` entries only for installed SDK or external modules:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: web
            kind: python
            module: kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.web_tools
            alias: web_tools
            allowed: [web_search, web_fetch]
```

For the canonical runtime rationale and testing rule, see
[bundle-runtime-README.md#critical-bundle-local-import-rule](../bundle-runtime-README.md#critical-bundle-local-import-rule).
For tool-specific details, see
[custom-tools-README.md#bundle-local-imports-from-ref-tools](../../tools/custom-tools-README.md#bundle-local-imports-from-ref-tools)
and [tool-subsystem-README.md#relative-imports-inside-ref-tools](../../tools/tool-subsystem-README.md#relative-imports-inside-ref-tools).
SDK `tool_config.py` should adapt `surfaces.as_consumer` into runtime specs; the
bundle-owned config/defaults are the policy source for which agent can call
which tool.

## 1B.3 Bundle Identity Rule

Treat bundle identity as a release contract, not as a casual string.

The same bundle id normally appears in:

- the bundle directory name
- `release.yaml`
- `entrypoint.py` / `@bundle_id(...)`
- `config/bundles.template.yaml`
- `config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml`
- interface files such as OpenAPI descriptions
- staged or deployment `bundles.yaml`

Choose one canonical value before implementation and keep the others aligned.
For content/application bundles, prefer `release.yaml` plus the bundle folder
name as the human-visible source of truth. `entrypoint.py` may still define a
constant for decorators, but it must match the release/config/interface value.

If a bundle is renamed, update identity-bearing files in one change and run the
shared bundle suite plus a real `kdcube bundle reload <bundle_id>` check. A mismatch
can look like a manifest miss, widget miss, or wrong bundle operation path.

## 1C. Bundle Design Decision Matrix

Before writing code, classify the product surface and state model.

| Product need | Primary surface | Typical runtime path | Typical state/storage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Copilot/chat experience | `@bundle_entrypoint` / `@on_reactive_event` | request-bound chat path | conversation stores, retrieval systems, bundle props | start here for assistant-style products |
| Admin console | `@ui_widget` + `@api(route="operations")` | widget -> operations | descriptor-backed config, bundle local storage, DB/Redis | keep admin separate from public/user surface |
| Named semantic provider | named service provider with local/API/MCP/Data Bus adapters | client/provider dispatch | owner storage plus transport-specific auth context | use when other bundles, widgets, agents, or scene hosts need stable access to owned objects, relations, actions, or namespace-level commands |
| Durable widget/domain mutation | Socket.IO `data_bus.publish` + `@data_bus_handler(...)` | Data Bus Redis Stream -> proc worker -> handler | bundle-owned DB/Redis/storage with idempotency | use for non-chat state changes that need retry or per-object serialization |
| External webhook/integration | `@api(route="public")` | public HTTP path | bundle props + secrets, external systems | auth boundary must be explicit |
| Tool-serving integration | `@mcp(...)` | MCP dispatch path | bundle props + secrets, external systems | bundle owns MCP auth |
| Background automation | `@cron(...)` plus `@on_job` for ready work | cron scan -> Redis job stream -> proc `@on_job` | bundle local storage, DB/Redis, external APIs | cron detects due work; `@on_job` executes it fairly |
| Mixed product app | combine widget/API/chat/cron intentionally | multiple runtime paths | split state by storage tier | this is common; design boundaries explicitly |

State-placement rule:

- bundle props/secrets:
  deployment-scoped configuration
- bundle local storage:
  instance-local mutable files/workspaces/caches
- `BundleArtifactStorage`:
  persisted bundle artifacts
- DB/Redis/external APIs:
  runtime or business state

Conversation-event rule:

- a client-authored event is not a direct bundle call
- accepted events are ordered in the conversation event lane
- queue entries are wake pointers, not event bodies and not ordering authority
- proc may ignore an obsolete wake, defer to a fresh consumer, or schedule a
  turn by crossing the bundle-load/on-message fence
- ReAct timeline blocks are projections created by event-source policy, not
  the event bus itself
- stale owners must rollback through `ExternalEventLaneTurnSuperseded`, not
  commit stale output

For the full boundary map, read
[Conversation Events And ReAct Turns](how-to-understand-conversation-events-and-react-turns-README.md).

### Base Entrypoint Class Decision Table

Pick the entrypoint base class by what the app (bundle) needs. Each class is a
strict extension of the bare base; deriving one auto-wires the listed surfaces so
the subclass only enables/configures them instead of redeclaring them.

| Need | Derive | Import | Auto-wires | You still set |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plain chat/app | `BaseEntrypoint` | `from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.chatbot.entrypoint import BaseEntrypoint` | base UI build/prop-refresh contract | your graph, surfaces, config |
| Budget + rate limiting | `BaseEntrypointWithEconomics` | `from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.chatbot.entrypoint_with_economic import BaseEntrypointWithEconomics` | economics guard (budget + rate limiting) | economics props, `search_model_service(flow=...)` where needed |
| Memory without economics | `BaseEntrypointWithMemory` | `from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.chatbot.entrypoint_with_memory import BaseEntrypointWithMemory` | `memories` widget + ops, `mem` named service, reconciliation, snapshots, schema-ensure | `memory.enabled: true` plus the bits you want |
| Memory + economics | `BaseEntrypointWithEconomicsAndMemory` | `from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.chatbot.entrypoint_with_memory import BaseEntrypointWithEconomicsAndMemory` | economics guard plus everything `BaseEntrypointWithMemory` wires | `memory.enabled: true`, economics props |

See [Bundle Entrypoint Classes](../bundle-entrypoint-classes-README.md) for the
full family contract.

## 1D.1 Reuse SDK Building Blocks First

Before creating a new `services/`, `subsystems/`, `tools/`, or provider adapter
module, check:

- [how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md](how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md)
- [../../namespace-services/providers-README.md](../../namespace-services/providers-README.md)

Current reusable blocks include:

- Tasks Solution for saved tasks, schedules, executions, execution artifacts,
  due scans, task tools, and task/job skills;
- Email Integration for Gmail/iCloud accounts, OAuth/settings, attachment
  materialization, Email MCP, and Claude Code email processing;
- Telegram Integration for webhooks, Bot API rendering, progress streaming,
  Mini App auth, widget operations, registry storage, and signed downloads;
- Delivery Integration for email/Telegram report delivery and delivered-file
  metadata;
- built-in web, browser, rendering, exec, io, and context tools;
- storage/cache/git helpers, widgets, MCP, `@cron`, `@on_job`, `@venv`, and
  Node sidecar support.

Bundle code should normally supply:

- route aliases and decorators;
- product prompts and skills;
- user-scope and role policy;
- UI composition;
- deployment prop/secret paths;
- domain-specific storage that is not already part of a reusable SDK block.

### Shared SDK Widgets Via `sdk://`

Some widgets ship inside the SDK and are reused by reference, not copied. The
memories widget source lives at `context/memory/ui/widget/memories` and the
economics usage_card at `infra/economics/ui/widget/usage-card`. An app (bundle)
that wants such a widget needs **no `ui/` folder of its own**: it enables the
widget and points `src_folder` at the `sdk://…` path.

```yaml
ui:
  widgets:
    memories:
      enabled: true
      src_folder: sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories
      build_command: npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build
```

When the app derives from the memory mixin, the mixin already supplies the
memories widget's `src_folder`, so the app only needs
`ui.widgets.memories.enabled: true`.

The **`mem` named-service provider** is registered (and announced to Redis
discovery) automatically while `memory.enabled` is true — no extra wiring. Another
app's agent can consume that `mem` service instead of embedding the memory module
itself.

## 1E. SDK Configuration And Secrets Cheat Sheet

Keep this page compact, but do not hide the actual SDK helpers.

Use this quick map while writing code:

| What you need | Read | Write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| platform/global props | `get_settings()` | none |
| platform/global secrets | `await get_secret("canonical.key")` | none |
| deployment-scoped bundle props | `self.bundle_prop("path", default=...)`, `self.bundle_props` | `await set_bundle_prop(...)` |
| deployment-scoped bundle secrets | `await get_secret("b:...")` | `await set_bundle_secret(...)` |
| user-scoped bundle props | `get_user_prop(...)`, `get_user_props()` | `set_user_prop(...)`, `delete_user_prop(...)` |
| user-scoped bundle secrets | `await get_secret("u:...")` | `await set_user_secret(...)`, `await delete_user_secret(...)` |

Bundle user-scope rule:

- `user_id` in bundle storage, user props, and user secrets means the current
  bundle user scope. It is not guaranteed to be a KDCube control-plane account id.
- In KDCube-authenticated chat/widgets it may be the logged-in KDCube user.
- In public integrations such as Telegram it may be a bundle-approved external
  identity or a stable synthetic scope such as `telegram_<telegram_user_id>`.
- Roles/auth and user scope are related but separate: a Telegram user can be
  registered/admin for this bundle without owning a KDCube login.
- Never require every external user to map to a KDCube account unless the
  product design explicitly says so.

Hard rule:

- bundle code reads all scopes
- bundle code writes bundle-scoped and user-scoped values only
- bundle code does not write platform/global props or secrets
- request, tool, cron, and job paths use the awaited secret helpers directly

If long-lived helpers depend on bundle props:

- recompute or invalidate them in `on_props_changed(...)`
- do not assume a singleton bundle instance keeps prop-derived state valid forever

Use the full contract page only when you need the deeper ownership, storage, or
export rules:

- [bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)

## 1F. SDK Storage, Cache, And Git Cheat Sheet

Use this compact map while writing bundle code:

| Need | Use | Typical purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| local mutable files on this instance | `self.bundle_storage_root()` | workspaces, cloned repos, local indexes, generated files |
| same local root outside entrypoint code | `bundle_storage_dir(...)` | helper code that has no `self` |
| persisted bundle artifacts | `BundleArtifactStorage` | artifact read/write/list/delete through the storage backend |
| lightweight Redis cache | `create_kv_cache()` or namespaced cache helpers | small runtime cache, flags, lightweight transient state |
| git subprocess auth/transport | `build_git_env(...)`, `normalize_git_remote_url(...)` | PAT/SSH-safe git commands without mutating process-global env |

Hard rule:

- local mutable filesystem state -> bundle storage helper
- persisted bundle artifacts -> `BundleArtifactStorage`
- lightweight transient cache -> KV cache
- git auth/transport -> shared git helper, not custom `os.environ` mutation

Use the deeper docs only when needed:

- [bundle-storage-and-cache-README.md](../bundle-storage-and-cache-README.md)
- [cache-README.md](../../storage/cache-README.md)
- [git-store-README.md](../../storage/git-store-README.md)
- [sdk-store-README.md](../../storage/sdk-store-README.md)

## 2. Decide What Kind Of Bundle You Are Building

Before writing code, classify the bundle.

Typical bundle surfaces:

- chat-first workflow bundle
- operations/API bundle
- widget bundle
- main UI bundle
- MCP-serving bundle
- scheduled-job bundle
- mixed bundle with several surfaces

You should explicitly decide:

- what the primary user-facing surface is
- which methods are read-only
- which methods mutate state
- whether there is a separate admin surface
- what state must persist locally on the instance
- what state must be descriptor-backed

Do not collapse all authority into one public widget.

Preferred split:

- one end-user-facing React widget/web app when the product is naturally one app
- separate admin APIs for privileged operations
- separate admin widget only when the product needs a distinct admin app
- scheduled jobs for background automation

## 2.1 Process Environment Boundary

Multiple applications may run inside the same processor process.

That means:

- inherited processor environment variables are shared by design
- bundle code must not treat `os.environ` as private mutable state

For git-backed helpers in particular:

- read git configuration through `get_settings()` / `get_secret()`
- build a subprocess env dict for git commands
- pass that env only to the git subprocess
- do not write `GIT_HTTP_TOKEN`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, or similar values back into the processor process env

Correct pattern:

```python
import asyncio
import subprocess

from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.config import get_secret

async def fetch_repo():
    env = build_git_env(
        git_http_token=await get_secret("services.git.http_token"),
        git_http_user=await get_secret("services.git.http_user"),
    )
    await asyncio.to_thread(
        subprocess.run,
        ["git", "fetch", "--prune", "origin"],
        env=env,
        check=True,
    )
```

Interpretation:

- inherited process env remains shared
- descriptor-backed settings/secrets remain the normal source of truth
- explicit overrides remain local to the subprocess call only

Transport rule:

- git-backed workspace or storage repos may be configured with either HTTPS or SSH remotes
- if HTTPS token auth is configured, the shared helper prefers that path and may normalize an
  SSH-style remote such as `git@github.com:org/repo.git` to `https://github.com/org/repo.git`
- if SSH transport is intended, configure the SSH settings explicitly:
  - `GIT_SSH_KEY_PATH`
  - `GIT_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`
  - `GIT_SSH_STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING`
- do not half-configure both modes and assume git will choose the intended one silently

Operationally:

- HTTPS + PAT is usually the simpler deployment choice
- SSH is supported, but it requires key and host-verification material to be mounted and configured

## 3. Start From The Minimal Bundle Shape

Recommended layout:

```text
my_bundle/
  entrypoint.py
  agents/
    main.py
  config/
    bundles.template.yaml # default consumer tool/skill/event/UI policy
  requirements.txt    # optional, but required when bundle-local venv code needs Python deps
  tools/
  skills/
  ui/
    main/              # optional main-view React/Vite source folder
    widgets/           # optional widget React/Vite source folders
  tests/
```

Required in practice:

- `entrypoint.py`
- bundle registration decorators
- compiled graph or equivalent execution path

Usually present:

- `agents/main.py`
- `config/bundles.template.yaml` for default consumer tool/skill/event/UI policy
- `skills/` when the bundle has local skills
- `requirements.txt` when bundle-local Python deps are installed through `@venv(...)`

If the bundle ships a full main UI app:

- put source in `ui/main`
- declare `ui.main_view` with the source folder and build command in the bundle configuration
- let the bundle UI loader build into bundle storage
- use the loader-provided build destination such as `<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH>` when the build system needs the output path
- treat `VITE_BUNDLE_ID` or equivalent build-time values as fallbacks; the parent config bridge still supplies the runtime bundle id
- do not treat the built runtime storage directory as source

If the bundle ships a React widget/web app:

- put the widget app source under a stable widget folder such as `ui/widgets/<widget-alias>`
- declare `ui.widgets.<alias>.src_folder` and `build_command`
- inherit from the `BaseEntrypoint` family, for example
  `BaseEntrypointWithMemory` or `BaseEntrypointWithEconomicsAndMemory`, or
  implement the same `_ensure_ui_build(...)` contract so source-folder widget
  artifacts are built and refreshed
- use the standard build command shape:
  `npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build`
- make Vite write to `process.env.OUTDIR`; do not pass the output directory as
  `vite build <path>`
- keep the decorated `@ui_widget(alias="<alias>")` method as the manifest/entrypoint surface only
- expose structured data/mutation APIs separately through `@api(route="operations")`
- let the loader build the widget into bundle storage; do not render a TSX source file from Python for new widgets
- if you derive from a base class with widgets, disable unwanted inherited
  widgets through `enabled.widget.<alias>: false`; disabling
  `ui.widgets.<alias>` only disables the static source-folder app and may leave
  a method-rendered inherited widget visible
- for the full source-folder widget contract, use
  [bundle-widget-integration-README.md](../bundle-widget-integration-README.md)

### Minimal Graph For Non-Chat Apps

Even an app (bundle) with no chat product must still give the base a graph. In
`__init__`, set `self.graph = self._build_graph()`, and implement
`async def execute_core(self, *, state, thread_id, params)` that returns
`await self.graph.ainvoke(state)`. The pattern for a no-op is a single node that
sets `state["final_answer"]`:

```python
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(**kwargs)
    self.graph = self._build_graph()

def _build_graph(self):
    g = StateGraph(BundleState)
    g.add_node("noop", self._noop)
    g.add_edge(START, "noop")
    g.add_edge("noop", END)
    return g.compile()

async def _noop(self, state):
    state["final_answer"] = ""
    return state

async def execute_core(self, *, state, thread_id, params):
    return await self.graph.ainvoke(state)
```

See `examples/bundles/echo.ui@2026-03-30/entrypoint.py` and
`examples/bundles/user-memories@2026-06-26/entrypoint.py` for real instances of
this no-op shape.

## 4. Copy The Right Reference Pattern

Use `workspace` as the default reference bundle.

Reference doc:

- [workspace-reference-bundle-README.md](../workspace-reference-bundle-README.md)

Reference bundle root:

- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/workspace@2026-03-31-13-36`

Do not guess from older example bundles first.
Start from this reference unless your task is specifically about a capability it
does not cover.

Study in this order:

1. `entrypoint.py`
2. `agents/main.py`
3. `config/bundles.template.yaml`
4. `services/canvas.py`
5. `services/telemetry.py`
6. `skills/product/.../SKILL.md`
7. `ui/scene`
8. `ui/widgets/telegram_miniapp`
9. `tests/`

What `workspace` is good for:

- entrypoint and graph bootstrap
- workflow orchestration
- bundle-local tools and skills
- widget and operations integration
- public endpoint example
- bundle main UI example
- bundle storage usage

What `workspace` is not the reference for:

- `@cron`
- `@venv`

Use dedicated docs for those:

- [bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md](../bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md)
- [bundle-venv-README.md](../bundle-venv-README.md)

### React V2/V3 With Bundle Tools And Skills

Use React when the bundle's behavior should be driven by tools and skills.
Do not put business behavior directly in a public webhook or REST method if the
same behavior belongs to the agent.

For the full integration map across React tool config, bundle-served MCP, MCP
client config, and Claude Code subagents, read
[bundle-agent-integration-README.md](../bundle-agent-integration-README.md).

Canonical example:

- `workspace@2026-03-31-13-36` for the general config-first workflow pattern

Minimal shape:

```text
my.bundle@1-0/
  entrypoint.py
  agents/
    main.py
  config/
    bundles.template.yaml
  tools/
    task_tools.py
    user_memory_tools.py
  skills/
    product/
      tasks/
        SKILL.md
        tools.yaml
      user_memory/
        SKILL.md
        tools.yaml
```

Entrypoint responsibilities:

- register the bundle
- build the one-node graph that initializes SDK services
- instantiate the bundle entrypoint
- pass the turn state to `workflow.process(...)`
- keep public/operations APIs thin

Workflow responsibilities:

- construct the turn scratchpad
- call `start_turn(...)`
- persist the user message
- resolve `surfaces.as_consumer` into the active agent's tool and skill runtime
  inputs
- call `build_react(...)` with resolved tool specs, event-source specs, and
  resolved skill config
- run `react.run(...)`
- call `react.persist_workspace()`
- call `finish_turn(...)`

Descriptor and consumer-surface rules:

- expose bundle-local and SDK tools through
  `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools`; resolve the active agent config
  with `agent_tool_config_from_bundle_props(...)` into Python specs, MCP specs,
  tool runtime overrides, `allowed_plugins`, and
  `allowed_tool_names_by_alias`
- expose skill prompts through `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.skills`
- remember that skill discovery is registry-wide: core SDK skills, SDK solution
  skills, and bundle `custom_root` are all loaded before configured consumer
  filtering
- skills that declare required tools disappear automatically when those tools
  are not present in the active tool catalog; use `consumers` only for
  policy-level allow-lists or hard denies
- if a skill is valid only when specific tools are present, mark those entries
  with `required: true` in the skill's `tools.yaml`; ReAct removes the skill
  from the catalog/import/read path when required tools are missing from the
  active tool catalog
- make skill `when_to_use` rules operational, not vague
- for stateful skills, distinguish read/retrieval use from write/reconcile use
- use separate tool aliases for separate domains
- do not collapse different product concepts into one alias just because they
  are used by the same agent
- do not add generic SDK tools unless this bundle actually needs them
- skill visibility filters should use the real React decision agent ids:
  `solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong` and
  `solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular`
- avoid stale/legacy consumer ids in bundle descriptors; the ids should match
  runtime logs, accounting metadata, and model routing
- use `agent_disclosure: hidden` only for guidance that may be loaded by exact
  id/import but must not be advertised; use `AGENTS_CONFIG` to disable a skill
  for a consumer

Example consumer surface:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: automations
            kind: python
            module: kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.automations.tools
            alias: automations
            allowed: [list_automations, search_automations, create_automation]
          - id: user_memory
            kind: python
            ref: tools/user_memory_tools.py
            alias: user_memory
            allowed: [search_memo, create_memo]
```

Use `module` for installed SDK/external modules and `ref` for bundle-local
tool files. A `ref` tool can import same-bundle helpers with package-relative
imports such as `from ..services.storage import UserMemoryStorage`.

React version:

- React V2/V3 is selected by descriptor-backed platform config
  `ai.react.react_agent_version`
- do not hardcode the version in bundle code
- write the bundle against `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`

Model routing:

- every bundle-owned LLM call should have a stable role id such as
  `report.writer`, `memory.reconciler`, or
  `solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular`
- set normal defaults in `configuration` / `configuration_defaults()` under
  `role_models`
- let deployments override those defaults in `bundles.yaml -> items[].config.role_models`
  or live bundle props
- when a current API/MCP/cron/chat/job call chooses a temporary model strength,
  bind `bundle_call_context.role_models` around the downstream agent call
- the temporary override follows nested SDK agents, React, in-process tools,
  and isolated tool runtimes while the context is bound

Minimal ad hoc pattern:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import (
    bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch,
    get_current_bundle_call_context,
)

current = get_current_bundle_call_context()
role_models = dict(current.get("role_models") or {})
role_models["report.writer"] = {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
}

with bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch({"role_models": role_models}):
    await self._run_report_agent(...)
```

For the full code examples across `@api`, `@mcp`, `@cron`,
`@on_reactive_event`, and `@on_job`, read
[bundle-agent-integration-README.md#model-selection-for-agent-roles](../bundle-agent-integration-README.md#model-selection-for-agent-roles).

Channel rule:

- React writes to the communicator and timeline
- the timeline is the durable source of truth for what happened in a turn
- transport adapters such as Telegram should trigger or route agent work, then
  derive transport-specific output from the turn result/timeline
- do not duplicate task or memory business logic in the transport webhook
- when adding Telegram, read
  [Telegram SDK Integration](../../integrations/telegram/telegram-README.md)
  and use its bundle wiring checklist instead of hand-rolling transport,
  registry, delivery, or Mini App auth mechanics

Stateful asset rule:

- durable user/product assets should have one source-of-truth file per asset
  under bundle storage when local filesystem storage is appropriate
- use Markdown with YAML frontmatter for human-editable assets such as tasks or
  user memories
- frontmatter carries id, status, ownership, access policy, search labels,
  relations, schedule, and execution metadata
- the Markdown body carries the durable human-facing content, such as the task
  description or memory statement
- generated SQLite indexes are rebuildable retrieval surfaces, not source of
  truth
- expose search tools/APIs for assets that the agent must modify or delete, so
  the agent can find the right existing asset before changing it
- tool descriptions should state the intended scenario and sequence, for
  example search existing memory first, comment it when it matches, and create
  only when no existing memory captures the durable signal
- user-visible memory must have explicit policy metadata, for example
  `access_policy.visible_to_user: true`
- memory widget data may mark returned user-visible entries and comments as
  seen when the product explicitly treats widget open as a read receipt
- scheduled tasks should record the React execution conversation id that will be
  continued when the task fires

Gate rule:

- a separate gate LLM call is optional
- use it only when the bundle needs classification/routing/title generation
  that cannot be handled deterministically
- for simple task/memory bundles, start with a deterministic prepare step plus
  the React solver

Use the workspace reference bundle's `agents/main.py` as the agent/workflow
shape when in doubt.

### Telegram webhook with SDK integration

For Telegram, prefer the SDK-owned webhook flow instead of a custom generic
webhook handler:

```python
@api(
    alias="telegram_webhook",
    route="public",
    method="POST",
)
async def telegram_webhook(self, **update):
    return await telegram_user_admin.handle_webhook(self, **update)
```

### Widget plus structured API

```python
@api(alias="workflow-panel", route="operations", method="POST", user_types=("registered",))
@ui_widget(alias="workflow-panel", icon={"tailwind": "heroicons-outline:check-badge"}, user_types=("registered",))
def workflow_panel(self, **kwargs):
    return [self._render_dashboard_html(content=rendered_tsx, title="Workflow Panel")]

@api(alias="workflow-api", route="operations", method="POST", user_types=("registered",))
async def workflow_api(self, **kwargs):
    return {"items": []}
```

### Public MCP

```python
@mcp(alias="docs_public", route="public", transport="streamable-http")
def docs_public_mcp(self, **kwargs):
    return build_docs_mcp_app()
```

Reference:
- [bundle-platform-integration-README.md](../bundle-platform-integration-README.md)
- [bundle-transports-README.md](../bundle-transports-README.md)

### Bundle-authenticated MCP

from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.config import get_secret

@mcp(alias="docs", route="operations", transport="streamable-http")
async def docs_mcp(self, request: Request, **kwargs):
    header_name = self.bundle_prop("mcp.docs.auth.header_name", "X-Docs-MCP-Token")
    expected_token = await get_secret("b:mcp.docs.auth.shared_token")
    if request.headers.get(header_name) != expected_token:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=f"Missing or invalid {header_name}")
    return build_docs_mcp_app()
```

### Platform-gated surface via canonical `enabled.*`

```python
@ui_widget(
    alias="workflow-panel",
    icon={"tailwind": "heroicons-outline:check-badge"},
    user_types=("registered",),
)
def workflow_panel(self, **kwargs):
    return ["<div id='root'></div>"]
```

```yaml
bundles:
  items:
    - id: "workflow.panel@1-0"
      config:
        enabled:
          widget:
            workflow-panel: false
```

The platform derives the canonical bundle-props path from decorator metadata
(see section 4.2 for the full mapping). Use this when the platform should hide
or suppress the surface directly instead of the bundle method deciding at
runtime. Missing `enabled.*` keys are enabled by default, so descriptors should
not mirror all available surfaces as `true`.

### Bundle props and secrets

```python
async def sync_external(self):
    enabled = self.bundle_prop("features.auto_sync", False)
    api_key = await get_secret("b:external.api_key")
    ...
```

Reference:
- [bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)

User Memory subsystem config belongs in bundle props when the entrypoint derives
from the memory mixin:

```yaml
config:
  memory:
    enabled: true
    announce: {enabled: true, limit: 6, scope_filter: current_bundle}
    tools: {enabled: true, allow_write: false, default_scope_filter: current_bundle}
    widget: {enabled: true, allow_write: true, default_scope_filter: current_bundle}
    reconciliation: {enabled: true}
    snapshots: {enabled: true}
  ui:
    widgets:
      memories:
        enabled: true
```

Keep `tools.allow_write: false` unless the bundle has an explicit policy for
agent-authored durable memory changes. The widget remains user-owned CRUD.

### Bundle local storage

```python
root = self.bundle_storage_root()
workspace = root / "_workflow"
workspace.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

Reference:
- [bundle-storage-and-cache-README.md](../bundle-storage-and-cache-README.md)

### Per-bundle virtualenv helper

```python
@venv(requirements="requirements.txt")
def render_report(payload: dict) -> dict:
    return {"ok": True, "payload": payload}
```

## 4.2 Feature Gating With Canonical `enabled.*`

This feature is important enough to treat as a first-class authoring tool.

The platform-native feature flag for bundle surfaces lives under the
`enabled.*` section of effective bundle props. The platform derives the
lookup path from decorator metadata.

Canonical bundle-props shape:

```yaml
enabled:
  bundle: true|false
  api:
    "<route>.<api-alias>.<METHOD>": true|false   # flat key under enabled.api
  mcp:
    <mcp-alias>: true|false
  widget:
    <widget-alias>: true|false
  cron:
    <cron-alias>: true|false
```

Mapping per decorator:

| Decorator | Canonical path |
| --- | --- |
| `@bundle_entrypoint(...)` | `enabled.bundle` |
| `@api(alias=A, method=M, route=R, ...)` | `enabled.api["R.A.M"]` (flat key) |
| `@mcp(alias=A, ...)` | `enabled.mcp.A` |
| `@ui_widget(alias=A, ...)` | `enabled.widget.A` |
| `@cron(alias=A, ...)` | `enabled.cron.A` |

For API gates, the route-aware flat key `<route>.<alias>.<METHOD>` lives under
`enabled.api`; the legacy `<alias>.<METHOD>` key remains a fallback for
persisted descriptors. For `@mcp` / `@ui_widget` / `@cron`, the alias is a
normal nested map key.

Resolution rules:

- bundle code, decorators, and `configuration_defaults()` define defaults
- missing section, missing sub-section, or missing key → use the code default
- bundle-level `enabled.bundle = false` overrides every resource-level value
- resource-level value is checked only when `enabled.bundle` is enabled
- descriptors should contain only deployment overrides, usually `false` for
  rare disables, rather than mirroring enabled resources as `true`
- when an operator re-enables a previously disabled resource, reset/remove the
  explicit override instead of persisting `true`

Disabled values:

- boolean `False`
- integer `0`
- strings `false`, `disable`, `disabled`, `off`, `0` (case-insensitive)

Effect on each surface:

- API / MCP / widget: platform returns 404 when the surface is disabled
- cron: scheduler skips reconciliation for the job
- reactive event / on_job: covered transitively by `enabled.bundle`

Use it for:

- staged rollout
- environment-specific exposure
- disabling one job/widget/API/MCP without deleting code
- temporarily hiding unfinished surfaces

Do not use it for:

- secrets
- per-user authorization
- complex business predicates that depend on request payload or database state

Authoring rule:

- set switches in bundle props under `bundles.yaml -> config: enabled: ...`
- let the platform do the 404 / scheduler suppression instead of duplicating
  the check in method bodies

## 5. Entrypoint Rules

Every bundle should make the entrypoint simple and explicit.

Core requirements:

- register the bundle with `@bundle_entrypoint(...)`
- declare bundle identity with `@bundle_id(...)` when code-level identity matters
- compile the graph once in `__init__`
- keep route methods thin
- move real business logic into helper/service/orchestrator modules

Minimal pattern:

```python
from langgraph.graph import END, START, StateGraph

from kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.bundle_loader import bundle_entrypoint, bundle_id
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.chatbot.entrypoint import BaseEntrypoint
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.service_hub.inventory import BundleState


@bundle_entrypoint(name="my.bundle", version="1.0.0")
@bundle_id("my.bundle@1.0.0")
class MyEntrypoint(BaseEntrypoint):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.graph = self._build_graph()

    def _build_graph(self):
        g = StateGraph(BundleState)
        g.add_node("orchestrate", self._orchestrate)
        g.add_edge(START, "orchestrate")
        g.add_edge("orchestrate", END)
        return g.compile()
```

Entrypoint responsibilities:

- runtime wiring
- surface declaration through decorators
- lightweight access control
- creation of helper/service objects
- passing runtime context into those helpers

Entrypoint should not contain:

- large HTML blobs unless unavoidable
- business logic mixed with route handling
- direct deployment/env assumptions
- ad hoc local path construction next to the source tree

### Two-Layer Config Merge

App (bundle) config resolves in two layers, so a subclass only enables or
overrides what it wants instead of redeclaring a mixin's full config.

- the app declares its own defaults in `configuration_defaults()`
- a mixin contributes its own defaults through a `*_configuration_defaults()`
  method (for example `memory_configuration_defaults()` in
  `entrypoint_with_memory.py`)
- the `configuration` property deep-merges the mixin defaults into the effective
  config as a merge-of-missing-keys: the mixin only fills keys the subclass did
  not set

So for the memory mixin, `configuration_defaults()` typically only needs to
enable the bits the app wants (for example `memory.enabled: true`,
`memory.widget.enabled: true`); the mixin fills in the rest (reconciliation,
snapshots, schema, and the memories widget `src_folder`). Do not re-paste the
whole subsystem config block into the subclass.

### Validate The App

Run the bundle-contract suite against your app before any reload or release:

```bash
python -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tests.bundle.run_bundle_suite --bundle-path <app-folder>
```

This is the contract gate. It runs 200+ checks (`import_contract`,
`initialization`, `graph`, `execution_flow`, `storage`) against your app. See
[how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md) for the full test
workflow.

## 6. Runtime Context Rules

This must be explicit in the builder’s mental model.

Different bundle execution paths expose different runtime surfaces.
Do not write code as if every path looked like a request-bound widget call.

### Chat turn / SSE / socket-driven request

This is the normal processor-driven request path.

In this path, entrypoint code has request-bound runtime context:

- `self.comm`
- `self.comm_context`
- actor/session/routing details
- `self.bundle_props`
- `self.pg_pool`
- `self.redis`
- storage helpers
- `await get_secret(...)`

This is the path where communicator behavior is request-bound and peer/session-aware.

### REST bundle operation path

Bundle operations called through `/api/integrations/bundles/.../operations/...` also run with request-bound runtime context.

In this path, entrypoint code also has:

- `self.comm`
- `self.comm_context`
- `self.bundle_props`
- DB/Redis handles when available

So the practical rule is:

- chat/SSE path: request-bound comm context exists
- REST operations path: request-bound comm context also exists
- REST operations can emit live non-chat events over the already-open
  `/sse/stream` or Socket.IO connection when the client passes
  `KDC-Stream-ID`; use the recipe in
  [Client Transport Protocols: Non-chat App Events](../../../service/comm/client-transport-protocols-README.md#non-chat-app-events-over-the-shared-stream)

If a widget or host-embedded UI calls a bundle operation, do not treat it as a detached background job.

### Data Bus handler path

Data Bus is the durable non-chat inbound path for bundle-owned domain messages.
It is separate from REST operations and separate from chat turns.

Use this path when:

- a widget sends canvas/document/issue/object patches
- the message should survive browser disconnects
- the bundle needs retry, DLQ, idempotency, or per-object serialization
- the message should update bundle storage without becoming conversation
  history

In this path, entrypoint code has:

- `ctx: DataBusContext`
- `message: DataBusMessage`
- `self.bundle_props`
- DB/Redis handles when available
- storage helpers
- `await get_secret(...)`
- optional `ctx.reply.*` delivery through comm when reply metadata exists

Rules:

- define one handler per subject with `@data_bus_handler(...)`
- keep handlers `async def`
- do not start Redis consumers in the bundle
- persist durable state before sending success replies
- enforce idempotency and stale revision checks in bundle storage
- use `ctx.reply.*` only for connected-client status; state recovery should
  come from normal reads/fetches
- design widget clients for gateway admission errors before the handler runs:
  `data_bus.publish` can be rejected by
  `gateway.data_bus.ingress.publish_limits` when package rate, message count,
  or payload bytes exceed the deployment policy
- tune Data Bus publish limits in `gateway.yaml`, not in bundle props; bundle
  props may control bundle behavior, but platform ingress limits are deployment
  policy

Minimal pattern:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.data_bus import data_bus_handler

class MyBundle(BaseEntrypoint):
    @data_bus_handler(
        subject="my_bundle.object.patch",
        partition_by="object_ref",
        ordering="serial_per_partition",
        idempotency="required",
    )
    async def handle_object_patch(self, ctx, message):
        result = await self.objects.apply_patch(
            object_ref=message.object_ref,
            idempotency_key=message.idempotency_key,
            payload=message.payload,
            actor=message.actor,
        )
        await ctx.reply.ok({"revision": result.revision})
        return {"status": "ok", "data": {"revision": result.revision}}
```

### Cron / scheduled-job path

Cron is different.

When code runs from `@cron(...)`, there may be no meaningful end-user actor/session/socket context.

Do not assume in cron code that you have:

- a real user actor
- a request routing session
- a socket target
- request-bound streaming semantics

Cron-safe assumptions:

- bundle props are available
- storage helpers are available
- DB/Redis handles are available when configured
- request/actor/communicator details may be absent or not user-scoped

Practical rule:

- do not build cron logic around `self.comm_context.actor`
- do not depend on request headers or peer state
- pass explicit tenant/project/bundle scope into subsystem helpers when needed
- if cron discovers user/task work that may take time, enqueue a background job
  and handle it in `@on_job` instead of doing all work inside the cron tick

### Background job / `@on_job` path

`@on_job` is for ready work claimed by proc from the background job stream. It
is not a browser route and is not called through `/operations`.

Use it when:

- a scheduler scan finds due work
- a widget/API "run now" request should queue work instead of blocking the UI
- a bundle subsystem needs fair processor claiming and retry behavior

Rules:

- define at most one `@on_job` method in the bundle entrypoint
- make it `async def`
- if the bundle derives from SDK mixins, call `await super().handle_job(**kwargs)`
  first and return when it says `handled=true`
- validate `job["work_kind"]`
- read durable domain ids from `job["payload"]`
- use `job["metadata"]` only for transport/runtime hints such as
  `conversation_id`, `turn_id`, or display text
- update the bundle-owned execution/status/result record from inside the handler
- treat retry as possible until proc acknowledges the stream message

Minimal pattern:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.bundle_loader import cron, on_job

class MyBundle(BaseEntrypoint):
    @cron(alias="due-scan", cron_expression="*/5 * * * *", span="system")
    async def scan_due_work(self):
        due_items = await self.tasks.find_due_items()
        for item in due_items:
            await self.tasks.enqueue_job(item)

    @on_job
    async def on_job(self, job: dict, **kwargs) -> dict:
        handled = await super().handle_job(job=job, **kwargs)
        if handled.get("handled"):
            return handled

        if job.get("work_kind") == "task.execution.due":
            return await self.tasks.run_execution(job["payload"]["execution_id"])
        return {"ok": False, "handled": False, "error": {"code": "unsupported_job"}}
```

### Tool execution in normal in-process runtime

Tool modules do not get the same surface as the bundle entrypoint.

They should use the documented tool bindings such as:

- `_SERVICE` / `SERVICE`
- `_INTEGRATIONS` / `INTEGRATIONS`
- `_TOOL_SUBSYSTEM`
- `_COMMUNICATOR`
- `_KV_CACHE`
- `_CTX_CLIENT`

For common tool context, prefer:

- `kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.bundle_tool_context.scope()`
- `ok(...)` / `error(...)`
- `log_tool_start(...)`, `log_tool_success(...)`, `log_tool_error(...)`
- `host_files(...)` when a trusted bundle/catalog tool has materialized files
  that should become current-turn hosted artifacts

That helper resolves tenant/project/bundle id, bundle user scope, user type,
conversation/turn ids, bundle props, bundle storage root, output/work dirs, and
`bundle_call_context`.

Do not assume a tool module has:

- `self.comm`
- `self.comm_context`
- arbitrary entrypoint internals

Tool signature rule:

- only expose parameters the model can reasonably know or derive from the chat
- do not expose runtime ids such as `user_id`, `task_id`, `execution_id`,
  `conversation_id`, `turn_id`, internal `account_id`, or storage paths unless
  a previous tool returned an opaque reference specifically for the model to pass
- inject runtime identity through the tool subsystem, `bundle_call_context`, or
  job payload/context, then read it inside the tool implementation
- return opaque references for follow-up actions when a later tool needs exact
  storage/execution identity
- every model-facing tool description and return annotation must show the
  standard envelope and the concrete `ret` shape that will appear on the
  timeline. Do not stop at "Envelope: {ok, error, ret}" or "returns metadata".
  The solver chooses tools from this text.
- keep the shape compact but useful:
  `Envelope: {ok,error,ret}. ret={items:[{id,title,status}],count,next_cursor?}`
  is better than a long prose paragraph with no fields.
- if a tool returns provider/user data for later tool calls, include the exact
  identifiers and fields the model should reuse in the `ret` shape.
- if a tool returns user-visible files, return the standard envelope
  `{"ok": true, "ret": {"artifact_type": "files", "files": [...]}}` or use
  `host_files(...)` to host the files inside the tool before returning; the full
  declared-file contract is in
  [Custom Tools §4.2](../../tools/custom-tools-README.md#42-declaring-files-for-react-hosting)
- `host_files(...)` works only after the runtime has prepared the trusted tool
  context: active `ToolSubsystem`, hosting service, tenant/project/user/
  conversation/turn scope, conversation storage, and output directory. Normal
  React workflows prepare this through `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`;
  isolated execution prepares it through `bootstrap_bind_all(...)`.
- generated executor code should call a catalog tool through
  `agent_io_tools.tool_call(...)` when it needs file materialization or hosting;
  `host_files(...)` is for trusted bundle/catalog tools

### Tool execution in isolated runtime

Isolated runtime is narrower again.

It does not inherit arbitrary live Python objects from the host process.
It receives a reconstructed portable runtime contract.

That means:

- do not rely on random globals from the host process
- do not rely on live in-memory objects created in the parent process
- use only the documented portable surfaces
- trusted catalog tools still receive the reconstructed tool subsystem and can
  host files with `host_files(...)` when conversation storage is available

If code may run in isolated execution, write it as if only the documented bindings are available.

### Writing Rule

Before writing a method or helper, explicitly decide which runtime path it belongs to:

- request-bound entrypoint logic
- REST operation logic
- cron/system logic
- in-proc tool logic
- isolated tool logic

If code crosses those boundaries, make the dependency explicit instead of assuming one path behaves like another.

## 7. Singleton And Exclusivity Rules

These are related, but they are not the same thing.

### Bundle singleton

A bundle can be configured as `singleton`.

Meaning:

- the entrypoint instance is cached and reused inside the proc process
- subsequent requests reuse that same entrypoint instance instead of creating a fresh one each time

What singleton is good for:

- expensive bundle initialization you want to keep warm inside the process
- long-lived in-memory helpers that are safe to reuse
- reducing repeated setup cost

What singleton does **not** mean:

- it does not make bundle operations exclusive
- it does not serialize concurrent requests
- it does not give cross-process or cross-instance exclusivity
- it does not replace locks

Important runtime consequence:

- request-bound context is rebound on reuse
- singleton bundles must not treat request state as permanently stored on `self`
- singleton does not prevent another process, worker, or ECS task from loading the same bundle against the same storage

Practical rule:

- if the bundle is singleton, assume `self` is process-lifetime state
- request-specific data must come from the current request context, method arguments, or task-local/context-local surfaces
- do not make a `BaseWorkflow` subclass the decorated singleton entrypoint.
  Use the `BaseEntrypoint` family for the bundle surface and create
  `BaseWorkflow` inside per-message turn execution.
- shared filesystem or EFS work still needs an explicit shared-storage guard

### Exclusive operations

If you need “only one run at a time”, do not rely on `singleton`.

Use an explicit exclusivity mechanism.

#### For cron

Use `@cron(span=...)`.

This is the supported exclusivity control:

- `span="process"`
  - one run per proc process
- `span="instance"`
  - one run per host instance
- `span="system"`
  - one run across the whole deployed system for that tenant/project/bundle/job

For recurring background jobs, `span` is the first control to choose.

Default recommendation:

- use `span="system"` unless you explicitly want per-process or per-instance behavior

#### For non-cron operations

Use an explicit lock in the operation or subsystem logic.

Typical choices:

- Redis lock keyed by tenant/project/bundle/operation
- DB advisory lock or equivalent DB-scoped lock when appropriate
- local fallback lock only for standalone/local debugging

Practical rule:

- singleton controls instance reuse
- lock controls exclusivity

Do not confuse them.

## 8. Identity Rules

This is one of the easiest places to break bundles.

Runtime identity is descriptor-driven.
The source folder name is not authoritative when descriptors already define the bundle.

Authoritative identity sources, in order of trust:

1. loaded descriptor / `ai_bundle_spec.id`
2. explicit runtime bundle id passed into context
3. code fallback such as `@bundle_id(...)`
4. source folder name only as a last-resort local fallback

Do not build these from the source folder name when runtime already has descriptor context:

- storage roots
- workspace branches
- conversation IDs
- widget operation URLs
- admin operation URLs

If you ignore this, you will get split state:

- one local root for the source folder name
- another root for the runtime bundle id
- diverging branches, sessions, or archive trees

## 9. Configuration Rules

### Use the correct surface

For non-secret deployment config:

- `self.bundle_prop(...)`

For bundle-scoped secrets:

- `await get_secret("b:...")`

For platform/global secrets:

- `await get_secret("...")` or `await get_secret("a:...")`

For descriptor-file reads only when absolutely necessary:

- `get_plain(...)`

For platform settings:

- `get_settings()`

### Do not read deployment-owned config with raw `os.getenv(...)`

Bundle logic should not depend on raw env variable names for operational config when the platform already provides:

- `bundle_prop(...)`
- `get_settings()`
- `get_secret(...)`
- `get_plain(...)`

Treat this as prohibited in normal bundle code:

- do not call `os.getenv(...)` or read `os.environ[...]` for deployment-owned
  config or secrets
- do not invent bundle-local env variable names as a second config contract

Exception:

- direct env access is acceptable only in code that explicitly lives at the
  iso-runtime or sandbox boundary and is intentionally driven by process env

If you add a standalone helper script for local debugging:

- load `.env` into the platform settings path
- then read through `get_settings()` / `get_secret()`
- do not let the runtime bundle depend on bundle-local `.env` files

### Do not call the secrets provider directly

Bundle or feature code must not call secrets-provider internals such as
`get_secrets_manager(...).get_secret(...)` directly.

Use:

- `await get_secret(...)` in async code
- `get_settings()` for promoted secret-backed settings

Reason:

- direct provider calls bypass canonical key handling, env-first behavior, and
  mode-specific resolution
- they couple bundle code to one provider implementation instead of the
  supported helper contract

### Do not open descriptor YAML files through hardcoded paths

Bundle code must not open `assembly.yaml`, `bundles.yaml`, or other descriptor
YAML files through hardcoded filesystem paths.

Use:

- `get_plain(...)` for raw descriptor inspection
- `bundle_prop(...)` for effective bundle config
- `get_settings()` for effective typed platform/runtime settings

Reason:

- direct file opens hardcode one runtime path layout
- they bypass descriptor path indirection and alternate runtime wiring
- they are easier to break in direct local runs, tests, and non-default mounts

### Descriptor-backed values are the durable source of truth

If a setting must survive reload and deployment refresh, it belongs in descriptors and bundle props.

Typical examples:

- cron expression
- default window sizes
- feature toggles
- workspace repo/branch overrides
- validation toggles
- public callback/webhook base URLs used by external providers during
  deployment or local-public testing

When a bundle exposes a provider-facing public route that must be tested from
localhost, design the route URL as descriptor-backed config and use
[Serving Local KDCube With Ngrok](../../../service/cicd/ngrok-README.md) for
the local public HTTPS origin. Do not hardcode `localhost` into bundle code for
Telegram webhooks, OAuth callbacks, or remote callback/control integrations.

## 10. Local Storage Rules

If the bundle needs mutable filesystem state on the proc instance, use the platform helper.

Do not:

- write mutable runtime data into the bundle source tree
- create a repo-relative `.runtime/` folder for operational data
- assume current working directory is stable or durable

Use:

- `self.bundle_storage_root()`
- or `bundle_storage_dir(...) / "_subsystem"` only when you are outside entrypoint code and do not have `self.bundle_storage_root()`

Use local bundle storage for:

- cloned repos
- local archive mirrors
- prepared indexes
- cron workspaces
- temporary generated files that belong to this instance

This is separate from `BundleArtifactStorage`.

Mental model:

- local bundle storage = instance-visible filesystem
- `BundleArtifactStorage` = backend storage API for bundle artifacts
- hosted conversation files = current-turn user-visible artifacts; use
  `ret.artifact_type == "files"` with `ret.files[]` or `host_files(...)`
  instead of treating bundle storage paths as deliverable links

## 11. Widget Design Rules

Widget bundles fail most often because authors treat them like isolated frontends.
They are not.

KDCube widgets are bundle UI surfaces. They are usually React/TSX web apps that
KDCube builds and serves next to the bundle APIs/MCP endpoints. A consuming
frontend may embed the served UI in an iframe for isolation, and the KDCube
control plane often does that, but there is no special "bundle iframe" object in
the bundle contract. Do not create ad hoc HTML fragments unless you are
maintaining a legacy widget.
For a product with several panels, prefer one React widget with internal tabs or
routes over several disconnected widgets.

New widgets should use the same source-folder/build/storage model as main UI.
The usual bundle config shape is:

```yaml
ui:
  widgets:
    task_memo_webapp:
      enabled: true
      src_folder: ui/widgets/task_memo_webapp
      build_command: npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build
```

The loader builds that source folder into shared bundle storage under
`ui/widgets/<alias>`. Browser requests to widget subpaths fall back to the built
`index.html`, so a single widget can support tabs/routes and later be reused as
a Telegram WebApp surface.

Use `npm ci` when the widget source folder commits a lockfile. For early
prototype widgets without a lockfile, `npm install --no-package-lock` avoids
mutating the source folder during loader builds.

Source-folder behavior is per widget alias. If a subclass inherits other
`@ui_widget` methods from `BaseEntrypoint`, those widgets continue to use the
legacy method-rendered HTML path unless their own alias also has
`ui.widgets.<alias>.src_folder/build_command`.

To hide an inherited widget, set `enabled.widget.<alias>: false`. To replace an
inherited widget UI, keep or inherit the `@ui_widget(alias="<alias>")` surface
and configure the same alias under `ui.widgets.<alias>`. If code must replace
the decorator metadata, override the same Python method name. Do not add a
second decorated method with the same alias.

### Required contract

The widget must:

- request runtime config from the parent frame
- accept both `CONN_RESPONSE` and `CONFIG_RESPONSE`
- use host-provided auth tokens
- build operation URLs from runtime config

Required config fields:

- `baseUrl`
- `accessToken`
- `idToken`
- `idTokenHeader`
- `defaultTenant`
- `defaultProject`
- `defaultAppBundleId`

Do not hardcode:

- tenant
- project
- bundle id
- localhost URLs
- source-folder names in operation URLs

For custom main-view UI apps, use the same config bridge. The value sent as
`defaultAppBundleId` is the runtime bundle id selected by the host. Use it for
`/sse/chat`, `/api`, `/mcp`, and widget calls. A compiled bundle id is only a
standalone fallback.

For `/sse/chat`, new conversations must omit `conversation_id`. The UI should
bind the server-generated conversation id from the HTTP ack or the first SSE
envelope.

### Widget routes and subpaths

The side panel fetches widgets through:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/widgets/{widget_alias}
```

That API returns a JSON envelope containing the rendered widget HTML for the
host UI. A client may place that HTML in an iframe, but iframe embedding is a
client display choice. The same route can serve direct HTML when requested by a
browser, and subpaths are supported for single-web-app routing:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/widgets/{widget_alias}/{widget_path}
```

If the widget method accepts `widget_path` or `path`, the platform passes the
subpath so the React app can select its initial route or tab. This is the
preferred shape when the same widget will become a Telegram WebApp.

If a source-folder widget must load before platform auth exists, for example as
a Telegram Mini App, use the public static route for the app shell:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/public/widgets/{widget_alias}/{widget_path}
```

Only static widget assets are public through that route. The widget's data and
action APIs still need their own bundle-level request auth, such as Telegram
WebApp `initData` verification on every request.

### Separate display and structured API

Recommended pattern:

- widget method:
  - `@ui_widget(alias="workflow-panel", ...)`
- compatibility operation on the same method if needed:
  - `@api(alias="workflow-panel", route="operations", ...)`
- separate structured backend API:
  - `@api(alias="workflow-api", route="operations", method="POST", ...)`

The widget should call the structured API alias, not the widget alias.

### Public and admin capabilities should be separated

Good pattern:

- one end-user React web app when the product is naturally one app
- admin controls are separate panels or routes only when the product requires
  them in that app
- mutating/admin operations are always separate `@api` methods with roles

Do not expose destructive or administrative operations without role checks.
Use widget composition for UX, and API roles for authority.

### Read-only load by default

Initial widget load should not mutate external state.

Exception: a widget may perform a small explicit read-receipt mutation when the
product defines opening the widget as acknowledgement, such as marking returned
memory entries/comments as seen. This should be documented in the widget API and
must not trigger expensive sync, execution, commit, push, or rebuild work.

Prefer:

- initial load: read-only bootstrap
- explicit button such as `Refresh`, `Sync`, `Run now`, `Save settings` for mutations

This avoids accidental pushes or expensive jobs on every widget open.

### Operation body shape

For widgets, preferred POST body shape is:

```json
{ "data": { "operation": "bootstrap", "payload": { ... } } }
```

The integrations layer also accepts raw JSON objects, but widget code should use the platform wrapper consistently.

Also remember:

- integrations responses are enveloped
- widgets should unwrap the `[alias]` field in the response body

## 12. Access Control Rules

Use `user_types` and `roles` correctly.

Current `user_types` order:

- `anonymous < registered < paid < privileged`

This is threshold-based, not exact-match.

Examples:

- `user_types=("registered",)` means registered-or-higher
- `user_types=("paid",)` means paid-or-higher
- `user_types=("privileged",)` means privileged only

Use `roles=(...)` for raw external roles such as:

- `kdcube:role:super-admin`

If both `user_types` and `roles` are present:

- both must pass

For admin widgets and APIs, use the platform’s privileged pattern.

When Bundle Admin should be able to change the default visibility without a code
release, declare config paths in the decorators:

```python
@bundle_entrypoint(
    name="My Bundle",
    version="1.0.0",
    allowed_roles=("kdcube:role:viewer",),
    allowed_roles_config="visibility.bundle.allowed_roles",
)
class MyBundle(BaseEntrypoint):
    @api(
        alias="admin_data",
        user_types=("privileged",),
        user_types_config="visibility.api.admin_data.user_types",
        roles_config="visibility.api.admin_data.roles",
    )
    async def admin_data(self, **kwargs):
        ...

    @ui_widget(
        alias="admin",
        icon={"type": "emoji", "value": "⚙️"},
        user_types=("privileged",),
        user_types_config="visibility.widget.admin.user_types",
        roles_config="visibility.widget.admin.roles",
    )
    async def admin_widget(self, **kwargs):
        ...
```

Use decorator values as sane defaults and config paths as deployment-time
overrides. Do not pass removed `enabled_config` arguments to `@api` or `@mcp`;
resource enabled state is controlled through bundle props/Admin resource
overrides. `@mcp` does not use `user_types_config` or `roles_config`; the
bundle-served MCP app owns request authentication and authorization.

For public routes whose authentication is owned by the external integration,
for example Telegram Mini App APIs that verify signed Telegram `initData`,
keep generic KDCube `user_types`/`roles` empty on the public alias. Platform
visibility is evaluated before the bundle verifies external identity, so the
request may intentionally be anonymous at that layer. Enforce the external role
inside the bundle integration handler.

In entrypoints derived from `BaseEntrypoint`, prefer:

- `_ensure_privileged(...)`

This keeps the access check consistent with the rest of the platform.

For request-bound identity in bundle APIs, widgets, MCP handlers, tools, or
nested runtimes, use `get_current_request_context()` or
`get_current_user_identity()` from
`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx`. The identity helper includes the
authenticated user's email when the session has one.

## 13. Scheduled Jobs And Background Pipelines

If the bundle runs background work through `@cron(...)` and `@on_job`, treat it as an operational subsystem.

Rules:

- lock the job so concurrent instances do not corrupt shared work
- use Redis lock with TTL when runtime Redis is available
- keep local fallback lock only for standalone/local use
- use bundle local storage for the working root
- keep schedule and first-run/default-window settings in bundle props
- use `@cron(span=...)` as the primary exclusivity control for scheduled jobs
- use `@on_job` for the actual ready-work execution when the work is per-user,
  long-running, retryable, or should be claimed fairly across processors
- keep one decorated `@on_job`; reusable SDK mixins should be reached through
  `super().handle_job(**kwargs)`, not by adding another decorated handler
- assume schedules are reconciled on startup, bundle registry updates, and effective bundle-props changes
- scheduled logic should read current props through the normal runtime path, not cached startup-only values

For automation that may still need operator control:

- keep cron for regular background runs
- make "run now" enqueue the same `@on_job` work shape as a due cron item
- expose a privileged admin API/widget for:
  - changing schedule
  - changing default window
  - running now
  - deleting bad outputs
  - rebuilding indexes or archives

## 14. Standalone Scripts Inside Bundles

Sometimes a bundle subsystem benefits from a local standalone runner for debugging.
That is acceptable, but only under these rules:

- standalone mode is for local development/debugging
- operational runtime must still work entirely through KDCube wiring
- standalone env must be loaded into `get_settings()` / `get_secret()`
- operational config must still come from descriptors/bundle props in real runtime

Do not let a successful standalone path hide a broken runtime path.

When a subsystem has both:

- standalone mode
- in-bundle runtime mode

you must test both.

## 15. Pitfalls That Recur In Real Bundle Work

### Pitfall: using the source folder name as runtime bundle id

Symptom:

- storage root, workspace branch, or session path differs between runtime and standalone

Fix:

- resolve bundle id from descriptor/runtime context first

### Pitfall: repo-relative mutable runtime folders

Symptom:

- state ends up under the bundle source tree
- reloads and operational data get mixed together

Fix:

- use bundle local storage helper

### Pitfall: widget only listens for `CONFIG_RESPONSE`

Symptom:

- widget gets stuck waiting for config in some host paths

Fix:

- accept both `CONN_RESPONSE` and `CONFIG_RESPONSE`

### Pitfall: widget builds `////operations/...` URLs

Symptom:

- missing tenant/project/bundleId in generated request path

Fix:

- treat config handshake as mandatory
- refuse to call operation endpoints when config is incomplete

### Pitfall: widget initial load mutates remote state

Symptom:

- opening the widget triggers syncs, commits, or background work

Fix:

- initial load read-only
- explicit buttons for mutating actions

### Pitfall: Python f-string HTML/JS/CSS builders with unescaped braces

Symptom:

- runtime `NameError` from CSS like `@page{...}` or JS template placeholders `${...}`

Fix:

- inside Python f-strings, escape literal braces as `{{` and `}}`
- test HTML-builder functions directly, not only by syntax compile

### Pitfall: runtime config read via `os.getenv`

Symptom:

- bundle works only under one local shell shape
- runtime descriptors and props are ignored

Fix:

- use `bundle_prop(...)`, `get_settings()`, `get_secret(...)`, `get_plain(...)`

### Pitfall: direct descriptor file reads through hardcoded paths

Symptom:

- bundle works only when descriptors happen to be mounted at one expected path
- direct local runs or alternative runtime layouts break

Fix:

- use `get_plain(...)` for raw descriptor inspection
- use `bundle_prop(...)` or `get_settings()` for effective runtime values

### Pitfall: direct secrets-provider calls from bundle code

Symptom:

- bundle is coupled to one secrets backend
- alias handling, env-first behavior, or provider substitution is bypassed

Fix:

- use `get_secret(...)` in async code
- use `get_settings()` for promoted secret-backed settings

### Pitfall: writing cron logic as if it were a request-bound widget/API call

Symptom:

- code expects actor/session/socket details during scheduled execution
- cron path breaks or behaves inconsistently

Fix:

- treat cron as system/background execution
- pass explicit scope into helpers
- do not assume request-bound `comm_context` details exist

### Pitfall: writing isolated-exec code against host-process globals

Symptom:

- helper works in one local path but fails in isolated execution

Fix:

- use only documented tool/runtime bindings
- assume isolated runtime reconstructs a narrow portable surface

### Pitfall: assuming `singleton` makes an operation exclusive

Symptom:

- concurrent requests or jobs still overlap
- state corruption happens despite singleton bundle configuration

Fix:

- use `singleton` only for instance reuse
- use `@cron(span=...)` or an explicit lock for exclusivity

### Pitfall: public widget and admin authority mixed together

Symptom:

- access model becomes unclear
- widget load surface becomes dangerous

Fix:

- keep privileged operations in separate role-protected APIs
- use a separate admin widget only when the UX should be a distinct admin app

## 16. Writing Checklist

Before considering the bundle “implemented”, verify:

- entrypoint decorators are correct
- runtime identity does not depend on folder name
- all mutable local state uses bundle storage helper
- all deployment config uses bundle props/settings/secrets instead of raw env
- widgets follow the host config handshake and do not assume a fixed iframe
- widget URLs are built from runtime config
- public load paths are read-only by default
- admin surfaces are separated and privileged
- singleton is used only when process-level instance reuse is actually wanted
- scheduled/background work is locked
- exclusivity is implemented with `span` or explicit locks, not by singleton
- cron/background logic does not assume request-bound comm context
- isolated-exec code does not assume host-process globals
- destructive operations are explicit
- bundle-local tests exist for bundle-specific logic
- shared bundle suite passes

## 17. Minimum Deliverable Standard

A bundle implementation is not complete when it only “works once”.

It is complete when:

- it follows the documented platform contract
- it survives reloads
- runtime identity is stable
- widget/API surfaces are discoverable
- state is stored in the correct tier
- local and runtime execution both work
- the shared test suite and bundle-local tests pass

If you are unsure, default to the simpler, more explicit design:

- thin entrypoint
- service/helper module
- separate admin surface
- descriptor-backed settings
- bundle local storage for mutable filesystem state
