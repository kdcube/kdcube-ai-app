# How To Navigate KDCube Bundle Docs

This page is only a navigation guide. It tells an agent how to find the right
KDCube documentation, how to resolve KDCube link formats, and which document to
open next for a bundle task.

This page is not the place for detailed implementation rules. Import rules,
widget rules, Data Bus rules, subsystem integration rules, release procedures,
and test procedures belong in their own documents and are linked from here.

## Navigation Flow

Use this order.

1. **Use KDCube docs/knowledge search first when available.**

   If the environment exposes a KDCube docs, knowledge, or MCP search tool, ask
   it a narrow question before scanning the repository. The result should give
   `ks:docs/...` or `repo:...` links. Treat those links as ranked entrypoints,
   then open the source docs they point to.

   Good search prompts:

   ```text
   how to integrate an SDK subsystem into a bundle
   widget visibility user_types_config roles_config
   source-folder widget sdk shared_sources
   bundle data bus handler object_ref partitioning
   React event source timeline announce policy
   ```

2. **Resolve returned links.**

   KDCube docs use logical links:

   | Link | Meaning |
   | --- | --- |
   | `ks:docs/...` | Knowledge-space doc id. In this repo it resolves below `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/...`. |
   | `repo:kdcube-ai-app/...` | Path relative to the KDCube platform repo checkout. |
   | `repo:applications/...` | Path relative to the applications/content repo checkout. |
   | `repo:website/...` | Path relative to the website repo checkout. |
   | relative Markdown link | Resolve relative to the current doc file. |

   Do not replace reusable docs with one developer's absolute filesystem path.
   Use `ks:` and `repo:` links in docs and handoff notes.

3. **Open the smallest set of source docs needed.**

   Read the doc that directly matches the task. Follow `see_also` only when the
   first doc explicitly says the other surface is required.

4. **Use repository search only after docs search is insufficient.**

   Use `rg` for source navigation. Do not infer platform contracts only from
   one implementation file when a doc exists.

5. **When docs and source disagree, record the gap.**

   Fix the code or the doc that is wrong. If you cannot fix it in the current
   task, write a short dated note in the nearest component journal and link the
   exact doc/source paths.

## Tier 1 Bundle Pack

For serious bundle work, read these as one compact pack:

| 1 | this page | Find the right docs and resolve `ks:` / `repo:` links. |
| 2 | [how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md) | Know what the bundle must prove before designing the change. |
| 3 | [how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md](how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md) | Reuse existing SDK/platform blocks before writing new mechanics. |

## Role Paths

Use these paths only to choose the first docs. Real bundle work often combines
several roles.

| Role | Start With |
| --- | --- |
| Bundle creator | test -> assemble -> write -> config/secrets -> configure/run |
| Existing app wrapper | assemble -> write -> platform integration -> configure/run -> test |
| Subsystem integrator | subsystem integration -> widget integration -> entrypoint classes -> events/agent docs as needed |
| Configurator | bundle runtime configuration -> properties/secrets lifecycle -> configure/run |
| Local QA | test -> configure/run -> platform integration |
| Release owner | test -> release content -> delivery/update |

## Agent Rules

- Prefer docs/knowledge MCP search when available.
- Preserve `ks:` and `repo:` links in notes and docs.
- Open source docs behind returned links before changing code.
- Do not read the whole docs tree unless the task is a docs audit.
- Do not paste implementation rules into this navigation page; add them to the
  specific implementation doc and link it from here.
- When adding a new reusable SDK subsystem, add its package docs and add one
  routing row to this page only if it changes the navigation map.
