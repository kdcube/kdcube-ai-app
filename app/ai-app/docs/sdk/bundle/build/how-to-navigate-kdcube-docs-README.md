# How To Navigate KDCube Bundle Docs

This page is the Tier 1 entrypoint for people who do not want to read the whole
SDK tree.

## Link Conventions

KDCube docs use two kinds of logical references:

- `ks:docs/...` is a KDCube knowledge-space doc id. In a local checkout it
  resolves under `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/...`.
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/...`, `repo:applications/...`, and `repo:website/...`
  are cross-repository aliases used by agent onboarding docs outside this doc
  tree. Resolve them to the corresponding local checkout before opening files.

Inside this KDCube docs tree, ordinary relative Markdown links resolve relative
to the current file. Prefer these logical links in reusable docs instead of
machine-specific absolute paths.

Use it when you are:

- creating a new bundle from scratch
- wrapping an existing backend, UI, webhook, cron job, or tool into a bundle
- mapping existing app configuration into KDCube scopes
- wiring a bundle into a KDCube environment and operating it locally
- validating a bundle with local tests or runtime integration tests
- integrating an existing bundle into a KDCube environment
- trying to find the right doc fast without guessing from filenames

Important:

- these roles are not separate "brains"
- they are task facets used to choose the next best document
- one real task often combines several roles in sequence, for example:
  creator -> configurator -> deployer -> local QA -> integration QA
- the same agent should be able to plan across those roles without resetting
  context

## 1. The Short Answer

Do not start by reading every bundle doc.

Do treat Tier 1 as one compact pack.

Start with these seven Tier 1 baseline pages in this order:

1. this page
2. [how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md)
3. [how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md](how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md)
4. [how-to-write-bundle-README.md](how-to-write-bundle-README.md)
5. [../bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle-README.md](../bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle-README.md)
6. [../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)
7. [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)

Read those seven together as one bundle-authoring baseline.

Critical Python import rule:

- bundle-local code must use package-relative imports such as
  `from .services.storage import ...`
- do not import bundle-local folders as top-level packages such as `services`,
  `apps`, `tools`, or `resources`
- for bundle-local tools, `tools_descriptor.py` should use `ref` entries and
  tool modules should import same-bundle helpers with package-relative imports;
  use `module` only for installed SDK/external modules
- see [bundle-runtime-README.md#critical-bundle-local-import-rule](../bundle-runtime-README.md#critical-bundle-local-import-rule)
  and [custom-tools-README.md#bundle-local-imports-from-ref-tools](../../tools/custom-tools-README.md#bundle-local-imports-from-ref-tools)

Critical widget/browser rule:

- any widget, generated HTML app, or bundle UI that calls KDCube APIs must use
  the KDCube frame/runtime origin, not the top-level page that may be embedding
  KDCube
- use `baseUrl` from the KDCube runtime config bridge first; if missing, fall
  back to that frame's own `window.location.origin`
- never use `window.top.location`, `document.referrer`, or a host-page URL as
  the API base
- read [bundle-widget-integration-README.md#frame-origin-and-api-base-url](../bundle-widget-integration-README.md#frame-origin-and-api-base-url)
  before writing widget networking code
- if the widget reuses SDK UI such as User Memory or Telegram admin/channels
  panels, also read
  [bundle-widget-integration-README.md#shared-ui-source-materialization](../bundle-widget-integration-README.md#shared-ui-source-materialization)

There is also one optional Tier 1 lifecycle procedure:

- [how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md](how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md)

Use it when the user agrees that the bundle should be committed, tagged,
pushed, or wired into a git-backed descriptor ref. It is recommended for
repeatable bundle work, but it is not an automatic step.

There is also one conditional Tier 1 local-runtime procedure:

- [how-to-bootstrap-local-bundle-runtime-as-coding-agent-README.md](how-to-bootstrap-local-bundle-runtime-as-coding-agent-README.md)

Use it when the agent is expected to configure and run a local KDCube runtime,
wire a bundle into `bundles.yaml` / `bundles.secrets.yaml`, start ngrok for
provider callbacks, configure Telegram or Gmail deployment values, and report
only the external provider steps it cannot complete.

When the bundle defines an agent surface, custom tools/skills,
file-producing tools, MCP connectors, bundle-served MCP, or Claude Code
subagents, add this focused page to the Tier 1 pack:

- [../bundle-agent-integration-README.md](../bundle-agent-integration-README.md)

When choosing the Python entrypoint base class, especially for economics,
memory, inherited widgets, or source-folder UI builds, read:

- [../bundle-entrypoint-classes-README.md](../bundle-entrypoint-classes-README.md)

When the local runtime must be reachable from the public internet for provider
callbacks, add this service note:

- [../../../service/cicd/ngrok-README.md](../../../service/cicd/ngrok-README.md)

Use it for local Telegram webhooks, OAuth/Cognito callbacks, and other
callback or remote-control flows that cannot call `localhost` directly.

## 1A. Where To File Builder Assessments

When a builder agent discovers confusing docs, missing runtime guidance, CLI
friction, or repeated setup pain, write it down in the right place while the
context is fresh.

Use this placement rule:

- bundle-specific findings go under
  `<bundle>/docs/instructions/improvements/YY.MM.DD-short-topic.md`
- bundle implementation decisions go in `<bundle>/docs/journal/journal.md`
- platform CLI findings go under the CLI/component journal, for example
  `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_cli/doc/journal/`
- SDK/runtime findings go in the nearest component or design journal, and the
  bundle report should link to that platform-side note

Keep these notes short, dated, and actionable. Separate "docs should explain
this" from "platform code should change this" so later agents can improve the
right surface without re-reading unrelated logs.

The order helps, but the important rule is:

- do not stop after only one Tier 1 page
- do not replace the Tier 1 pack with random deeper docs
- branch to deeper docs only after the Tier 1 pack is understood

Correction:

- the test guide is not only an end-of-task validation page
- it also tells the agent what the bundle must prove in the real runtime
- reading it early usually improves design and reduces wasted implementation

So the practical Tier 1 reading order is:

1. navigation
2. test expectations
3. reusable SDK/platform building blocks
4. bundle design
5. configuration ownership
6. local runtime and deployment wiring
7. coding-agent local-runtime bootstrap, when live setup is part of the task
8. optional release lifecycle, only when agreed with the user

## 2. Which Path Fits Your Job

Use the sections below as entry paths, not as mutually exclusive personas.

Normal bundle work often crosses several of them in one task.

Use them to choose the best first page when orientation is needed.

They do not replace the rule above:

- the agent should still read the whole Tier 1 pack for serious bundle work

Example:

- when wrapping an existing app, the same agent may need to act as:
  integrator, configurator, deployer, and QA
- when creating a new bundle, the same agent may need to act as:
  creator, configurator, deployer, and integration QA

### A. I am creating a new bundle

Start here, then complete the rest of the Tier 1 pack:

1. [how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md)
2. [how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md](how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md)
3. [how-to-write-bundle-README.md](how-to-write-bundle-README.md)
4. [../bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle-README.md](../bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle-README.md)
5. [../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)
6. [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)
7. [../bundle-platform-integration-README.md](../bundle-platform-integration-README.md)
8. [../bundle-runtime-README.md](../bundle-runtime-README.md)
9. [../versatile-reference-bundle-README.md](../versatile-reference-bundle-README.md)
10. [how-to-bootstrap-local-bundle-runtime-as-coding-agent-README.md](how-to-bootstrap-local-bundle-runtime-as-coding-agent-README.md), when the user wants the agent to run local setup
11. [how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md](how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md), only when the user wants a pinned release

Interpretation:

- `how-to-test` tells you what the bundle must prove and which runtime paths
  must exist
- `how-to-assemble` tells you which SDK/platform blocks already exist before
  you write new services
- `how-to-write` tells you what to build
- `bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle` tells you how code defaults,
  descriptor/admin props, effective props, and bundle secrets flow at runtime
- `bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets` tells you where values belong
- `how-to-configure-and-run` tells you how the runtime is staged and wired
- `bundle-platform-integration` tells you how to expose the surfaces
- `bundle-runtime` tells you what runtime helpers exist
- `versatile` shows a working bundle shape

### B. I am wrapping existing user code into a bundle

Start here, then complete the rest of the Tier 1 pack:

1. [how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md)
2. [how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md](how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md)
3. [how-to-write-bundle-README.md](how-to-write-bundle-README.md)
4. [../bundle-platform-integration-README.md](../bundle-platform-integration-README.md)
5. [../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)
6. [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)
7. [../versatile-reference-bundle-README.md](../versatile-reference-bundle-README.md)

Practical rule:

- read the test page early so you know the bundle contract you must satisfy
- check the assembly map before copying or writing provider/runtime mechanics
- keep the existing business logic in reusable helpers or a delegated service
- make the bundle layer a thin KDCube adapter
- map the existing surface to the right decorator contract:
  - webhook -> `@api(route="public")`
  - admin/backend action -> `@api(route="operations")`
  - bundle UI surface -> `ui.main_view` or widget + operations
  - file-producing assistant tool -> `ret.artifact_type == "files"` or
    trusted tool-side `host_files(...)`
  - MCP server -> `@mcp(...)`
  - background sync -> `@cron(...)`
  - ready background job execution -> `@on_job`
  - assistant workflow -> `@agentic_workflow` / `@on_message`

### C. I am configuring a bundle or translating an existing app config

Start here, then complete the rest of the Tier 1 pack:

1. [../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)
2. [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)
3. [../../../configuration/bundles-descriptor-README.md](../../../configuration/bundles-descriptor-README.md)
4. [../../../configuration/bundles-secrets-descriptor-README.md](../../../configuration/bundles-secrets-descriptor-README.md)
5. [../../../configuration/assembly-descriptor-README.md](../../../configuration/assembly-descriptor-README.md)

This is the right path if your main questions are:

- which values belong to platform settings vs bundle props/secrets vs user state
- how to model an existing app setting in KDCube terms
- which values are deployment-scoped and exportable
- which values are operational user state and not descriptor-backed

### D. I am integrating or deploying a bundle into a KDCube environment

Start here, then complete the rest of the Tier 1 pack:

1. [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)
2. [../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](../../../configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)
3. [how-to-bootstrap-local-bundle-runtime-as-coding-agent-README.md](how-to-bootstrap-local-bundle-runtime-as-coding-agent-README.md), when an agent should perform the local setup
4. [../../../configuration/bundles-descriptor-README.md](../../../configuration/bundles-descriptor-README.md)
5. [../../../configuration/bundles-secrets-descriptor-README.md](../../../configuration/bundles-secrets-descriptor-README.md)
6. [../bundle-delivery-and-update-README.md](../bundle-delivery-and-update-README.md)
7. [how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md)

This is the right path if your main questions are:

- how do I point the runtime at the bundle code
- where do bundle props and bundle secrets live
- when do I rerun install vs reload
- what is the real local runtime authority
- how do I export live deployment-scoped bundle state
- how can an agent wire the bundle into a local runtime, configure ngrok,
  Telegram, or Gmail, and report only the provider-side steps it cannot do

### E. I am doing local QA for a bundle

Start here, then complete the rest of the Tier 1 pack:

1. [how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md)
2. [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)

Use this when the main job is:

- syntax and import validation
- shared suite execution
- bundle-local pytest execution
- direct verification of cron helpers, serializers, builders, and other local code

### F. I am doing integration QA for a bundle

Start here, then complete the rest of the Tier 1 pack:

1. [how-to-test-bundle-README.md](how-to-test-bundle-README.md)
2. [how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md](how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md)
3. [../bundle-platform-integration-README.md](../bundle-platform-integration-README.md)

Use this when the main job is:

- widget/browser validation
- API validation
- MCP validation
- reload/reconcile validation
- cron/integration runtime validation inside a real KDCube environment

### G. I just need to browse the docs efficiently

Use:

1. [../bundle-index-README.md](../bundle-index-README.md)
2. this page

Then jump only to the row that matches your question.

Memory config quick example:

```yaml
config:
  memory:
    enabled: true
    announce: {enabled: true, limit: 6, scope_filter: current_bundle}
    tools: {enabled: true, allow_write: false, default_scope_filter: current_bundle}
    widget: {enabled: true, allow_write: true, default_scope_filter: current_bundle}
    reconciliation: {enabled: true}
    snapshots: {enabled: true}
  ui:
    widgets:
      memories:
        enabled: true
```

## 5. When To Stop Reading And Start Building

Stop reading and start coding once you can answer these clearly:

- what bundle surface am I exposing
- what runtime path will execute the code
- what values belong in platform settings vs bundle props/secrets vs user state
- what storage tier owns my mutable state
- how the bundle will be run locally
- how I will validate it before calling it done

If one of those answers is still fuzzy, jump to the corresponding deeper doc
from the table above instead of reading random pages.
