# Bundle Storage + Cache

This guide covers **per‑bundle storage** and the **KV cache** available to bundle code.

---

## Runtime-provided storage only

Bundle code must use the storage surfaces the runtime provides. It must not
invent host paths, mount paths, or storage URIs in bundle props. The deployment
layer chooses whether a storage surface is backed by local filesystem, EFS, S3,
or another backend; bundle code receives the resolved SDK/API surface.

For mutable local/runtime state, use `self.bundle_storage_root()` and create a
subdirectory below it. For artifact-style backend storage, use
`BundleArtifactStorage`. For small values, use the KV cache.

## Bundle artifact storage backend

`BundleArtifactStorage` is a backend storage API for bundle-owned artifacts.
Its backend is selected by runtime/deployment configuration, not by bundle
code. The physical URI may be localfs or S3, but that is an operator concern.

Use the API inside a bundle:
```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.storage.bundle_artifact_storage import BundleArtifactStorage

self.storage = BundleArtifactStorage(
    tenant="acme",
    project="myproj",
    bundle_id=self.id,
    storage_uri=None,  # or override per call
)
```

Common operations:
```python
self.storage.write("logs/run1.txt", "hello\n", mime="text/plain")
text = self.storage.read("logs/run1.txt", as_text=True)
names = self.storage.list("logs/")
self.storage.delete("logs/run1.txt")
```

Storage path layout (logical):
```
cb/tenants/{tenant}/projects/{project}/ai-bundle-storage/{bundle_id}/...
```

The `ai-bundle-storage` path segment is the current compatibility prefix for
existing deployments; new code should use the neutral `BundleArtifactStorage`
API name.

---

## KV cache (Redis)

Bundles can use the platform KV cache for lightweight state/config:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.service_hub.cache import create_kv_cache

cache = create_kv_cache()
await cache.set("my:key", {"value": 123})
data = await cache.get("my:key")
```

Use KV cache for:
- bundle props overrides
- small runtime config
- per‑tenant/project flags

---

## Shared bundle local storage (filesystem)

Bundles can prepare a **shared local filesystem** (local disk or EFS) to store
large read‑only assets, indexes, or any bundle‑specific data that should be
reused across conversations and instances.

Bundle code does not configure this root. The runtime resolves it and exposes
it through the bundle storage helpers.

Path layout (default):
```
<bundles_root>/_bundle_storage/<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>
```

Authoring rule:
- if bundle code needs instance-local filesystem storage, do not hardcode your own root
- resolve it through the platform helper
- never put `file://...` or host absolute paths in bundle-level props for this
  purpose
- for normal mutable runtime data that should survive across requests on the same instance, prefer an unversioned subdirectory under the helper-resolved bundle storage root

Use from bundle code:

```python
storage_root = self.bundle_storage_root()
local_root = storage_root / "_my_subsystem"
local_root.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

If you are not inside a bundle entrypoint instance, use the low-level helper:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.bundle_storage import bundle_storage_dir

storage_root = bundle_storage_dir(
    bundle_id=bundle_id,
    tenant=tenant,
    project=project,
    ensure=True,
)
```

Authoring rule:
- inside entrypoint methods, use `self.bundle_storage_root()`
- outside entrypoint methods, use `bundle_storage_dir(bundle_id=..., tenant=..., project=...)`
- always create your own `_subsystem` directory under that stable root
- do not create alternative primary roots and do not rely on version-suffixed bundle roots

Practical split:
- `self.bundle_storage_root()`
  - canonical tenant/project/bundle-local root chosen by the platform
  - use this in entrypoint code
- `bundle_storage_dir(...)`
  - same canonical tenant/project/bundle-local root
  - use this only in helpers that do not have `self.bundle_storage_root()`
- `BundleArtifactStorage`
  - backend storage API for bundle artifacts
  - separate from the shared local filesystem root
  - backend selection is runtime/deployment configuration
- `bundle_tool_context.host_files(...)`
  - current conversation/turn artifact hosting helper for trusted catalog tools
  - available in normal and isolated supervisor/runtime tool execution
  - use only after the tool has written or materialized the user-visible file
  - requires SDK-prepared tool context: hosting service, tenant/project/user/
    conversation/turn scope, conversation storage, and output directory

Conversation file hosting is separate from durable bundle storage. User-visible
files produced during a React turn should use the strict tool result contract
`ret.artifact_type: "files"` with `ret.files[]`, or `host_files(...)` from a
trusted tool, so the platform can register hosted metadata and emit `chat.files`.

Example pattern used in real bundles:
- knowledge/index preparation should live under the bundle storage root when a
  bundle needs a generated local index; package/source files are copied or
  materialized into this runtime-visible root during `on_bundle_load`
- mutable local workspaces such as a cloned repo or a daily pipeline state folder should live under an unversioned subdirectory like:
  - `<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>/_workflow`
  - `<tenant>/<project>/<bundle_id>/_knowledge_base_admin`

When `on_bundle_load()` prepares shared files under this root, protect the
mutation with a shared-storage critical section and a source signature. In local
multi-worker and EFS-backed cloud deployments, several proc workers can load the
same bundle at the same time. Only one owner should copy/build the shared
output; other workers should re-check the signature after the owner finishes.
Use the synchronization guidance in
[Synchronization Mechanisms](../../service/synch-mechanisms/critical-section-README.md)
for bundle-owned indexes, local mirrors, registries, or generated assets.

Important contract:
- the platform owns only the stable root selection:
  - `<bundle_storage_root>/<tenant>/<project>/<safe(bundle_id)>`
- the bundle owns everything below that root
- if the bundle wants rebuildable caches, it should create and manage them under that stable root explicitly

ReAct integration:
- Local bundle storage is not automatically a ReAct-readable namespace.
- If the agent needs document/source access, expose it through explicit bundle
  tools, namespace services, MCP/search tools, or a registered rehoster.
