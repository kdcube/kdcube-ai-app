# Bundle Runtime

This page explains the actual runtime surfaces available to:
- bundle entrypoint code
- bundle-local tools
- tool code running in isolated execution

Use this together with:
- [How To Assemble A Bundle With SDK Building Blocks](build/how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md) for the reusable SDK/platform blocks to prefer before writing a custom subsystem
- [Bundle Properties And Secrets Lifecycle](bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle-README.md) for how `self.bundle_props`, descriptor/admin props, and bundle secrets flow
- [Bundle Lifecycle](bundle-lifecycle-README.md) for phase ordering
- [Bundle Agent Integration](bundle-agent-integration-README.md) for React, tools/skills, MCP, and Claude Code wiring
- [Bundle Platform Integration](bundle-platform-integration-README.md) for public entrypoint design
- [Tool Subsystem](../tools/tool-subsystem-README.md) for descriptor and execution internals

## Mental model

There are two different runtime surfaces:

1. bundle entrypoint/runtime surface
   - `self.comm`
   - `self.comm_context`
   - `self.bundle_props`
   - `await get_secret(...)`
   - bundle storage helpers
   - DB/Redis handles passed into the entrypoint

2. tool-module runtime surface
   - `_SERVICE`
   - `_INTEGRATIONS`
   - `_TOOL_SUBSYSTEM`
   - `_COMMUNICATOR`
   - `_KV_CACHE`
   - `_CTX_CLIENT`
   - `REGISTRY`

They are related, but they are not identical.

## Critical Bundle-Local Import Rule

Bundle-local Python code must use package-relative imports for other code in
the same bundle.

Use:

```python
from .services.news import build_news_service
from .apps.news.news_pipeline import build_news_pipeline_service
from .orchestrator.workflow import WithReactWorkflow
```

From nested bundle packages, use the corresponding relative form:

```python
from ..tools import react_tools
from .service import NewsPipelineService
```

Do not use top-level imports for bundle-local folders:

```python
# Do not do this for bundle-local code.
from services.news import build_news_service
from apps.news.news_pipeline import build_news_pipeline_service
import tools
```

Reason: multiple bundles are loaded in the same processor process, and Python
`sys.modules` is process-global. Top-level names such as `services`, `apps`,
`tools`, `orchestrator`, or `resources` can collide across bundles. A later
bundle may then import another bundle's package or fail with
`ModuleNotFoundError` even though the files exist in its own bundle directory.

The bundle loader provides an isolated virtual package for directory bundles.
Package-relative imports are what keep bundle-local code inside that virtual
package.

Design note:

- proc intentionally loads many bundles in one worker process to share heavy
  runtime resources such as Redis/Postgres pools and process-local helpers
- the loader keeps compatibility with raw module-path descriptor shapes and
  `@venv` child loads, so it cannot make generic top-level bundle-local names
  globally safe
- the shared bundle suite now lints top-level imports of bundle-owned Python
  roots and reports them as authoring errors
- see [Bundle Loader Import Isolation](build/design/bundle-loader-import-isolation-README.md)
  for the history and rationale

Authoring requirements:

- keep `__init__.py` in bundle-local package directories that are imported
- use relative imports from `entrypoint.py` and from nested bundle modules
- reserve absolute imports for installed libraries and globally unique packages
- when wrapping existing code, either place it under the bundle package and
  convert internal imports to relative imports, or move it into a real
  installable package with a globally unique name
- tests should include a KDCube-loader or shared bundle-suite import check, not
  only a direct `sys.path.insert(bundle_root); import entrypoint` check

## Runtime entry paths

### 1) Chat turn path: processor + streaming request

Normal chat turns arrive through ingress, are queued, then executed by the chat
processor.

Relevant code:
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/processor.py`
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/proc/web_app.py`

Current flow:
1. ingress builds `ChatTaskPayload`
2. processor resolves the bundle from `routing.bundle_id`
3. `get_workflow_instance(...)` creates or reuses the entrypoint
4. `comm_context` is rebound for the current request
5. the runtime calls either:
   - `workflow.<operation>(**params)` when an explicit command is present
   - or `workflow.run(**params)` for the normal turn path

What the bundle has in this path:
- `self.comm`
- `self.comm_context`
- effective props via `self.bundle_prop(...)`
- `self.pg_pool`
- `self.redis`
- bundle storage helpers such as `bundle_storage_root()`
- secret lookup through:
  - `await get_secret("b:...")` for current bundle deployment secrets
- `await get_secret("...")` / `await get_secret("a:...")` for platform/global secrets
- `await get_secret("u:...")` for current-user secrets

## Portable bundle call context

`bundle_call_context` is the bundle-owned, request-scoped context room.

Use it when a bundle needs to put JSON-safe metadata into the current execution
so nested agents, tools, background handlers, and isolated runtimes can inherit
it without asking the model to pass those values as tool arguments.

This is the right place for per-invocation values such as:

- task or execution ids
- selected UI mode or user-requested agent strength
- request-scoped role model overrides
- bundle-owned correlation ids
- a small policy snapshot that should follow nested tool execution

It is not durable storage. It survives the current execution graph and child
runtime boundaries. It does not survive a later request unless the bundle stores
the relevant values somewhere durable, such as job payload/metadata, bundle/user
props, or bundle storage, and re-applies them on the later invocation.

### Concept diagram

`bundle_call_context` is attached to the current `ChatTaskPayload`, then bound
to task-local contextvars. That is what makes it visible to bundle code, tools,
and child runtimes.

```text
HTTP/chat/job request
        |
        v
+-------------------------------+
| ChatTaskPayload               |
| - routing / actor / user      |
| - request                     |
| - bundle_call_context  <------+  bundle code can add JSON-safe call metadata

| - PORTABLE_SPEC_JSON          |
| - EXEC_CONTEXT                |
| - BUNDLE_SPEC                 |
| - contextvars.comm_ctx        |
|   - REQUEST_CONTEXT           |
|   - BUNDLE_CALL_CONTEXT       |
+---------------+---------------+

                | child bootstrap restore
                v
isolated / Docker / Fargate runtime
same get_current_bundle_call_context() contract
```

`PORTABLE_SPEC_JSON` is platform-built. Bundle code does not extend it
directly. Bundle-owned per-call metadata travels through
`bundle_call_context`, which is included in the contextvar snapshot inside
`RUNTIME_GLOBALS_JSON`.

### Lifetime diagram

```text

        |
        | update_current_bundle_call_context(...)
        v

        |
        +----> child runtime gets snapshot copy
        |

        |

later request / later background job
        |
        v

unless the bundle stored the decision in durable state
and re-applied it for this invocation
```

### Read surfaces

| Runtime location | How to read |
|---|---|
| bundle entrypoint, `@api`, widget operation, chat turn | `self.comm_context.bundle_call_context` or `get_current_bundle_call_context()` |
| `@on_job` handler | `self.comm_context.bundle_call_context` or `get_current_bundle_call_context()`; proc seeds it from the job envelope |
| in-process tool | `get_current_bundle_call_context()` or `bundle_tool_context.scope()["bundle_call_context"]` |
| isolated exec / Docker / Fargate tool runtime | same as tool code after bootstrap restores `RUNTIME_GLOBALS_JSON` |

### Write surfaces

Bundle code can set or temporarily extend the context through:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import (
    bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch,
    get_current_bundle_call_context,
    update_current_bundle_call_context,
)

# Persist for the rest of the current invocation.
update_current_bundle_call_context({
    "my_bundle": {"selected_strength": "lite"},
})

# Temporarily apply around one nested run. ContextVar binding survives awaits
# inside the block and is restored afterwards.
with bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch({
    "my_bundle": {"selected_strength": "strong"},
    "role_models": {
        "my.named.agent": {
            "provider": "anthropic",
            "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
        },
    },
}):
    await self.run_named_agent(...)

current = get_current_bundle_call_context()
```

Rules:

- values must be JSON-serializable
- keep it small; pass ids, modes, and policy snapshots, not large documents
- use bundle-owned namespaces for custom keys, for example
  `{"my_bundle": {...}}`
- `role_models` is a reserved key inside `bundle_call_context`; the model
  router interprets it as a request-scoped model-role override
- never use this context for secrets
- do not cache it in singleton instance fields; it is per invocation

### Request-scoped role model override

Static model routing belongs in bundle props. One-call routing belongs in
`bundle_call_context.role_models`.

```text
bundle default -> bundle props override -> bundle_call_context overlay
                                      \
                                       -> ModelRouter(role)
```

Bundle default in code:

```python
@property
def configuration(self):
    config = dict(super().configuration)
    role_models = dict(config.get("role_models") or {})
    role_models.setdefault(
        "my.named.agent",
        {"provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"},
    )
    config["role_models"] = role_models
    return config
```

External bundle props override:

```yaml
items:
  - id: my.bundle@1-0
    config:
      role_models:
        my.named.agent:
          provider: anthropic
          model: claude-sonnet-4-6
        solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular:
          provider: anthropic
          model: claude-haiku-4-5
```

For one request, a bundle may overlay the same role through
`bundle_call_context.role_models`:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import (
    bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch,
    get_current_bundle_call_context,
)

current = get_current_bundle_call_context()
role_models = dict(current.get("role_models") or {})
role_models["my.named.agent"] = {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
}

with bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch({
    "role_models": role_models,
    "my_bundle": {"agent_strength": "lite"},
}):
    await my_agent_run(...)
```

Use the same call-context patch inside `@api`, `@mcp`, `@cron`,
`@on_message`, or `@on_job` when the current request/job chooses a temporary
agent model. For MCP servers, bind around the actual operation that performs
the model call; if the decorated method only builds an MCP app, bind inside the
app's later request handler.

The router precedence is:

1. `bundle_call_context.role_models` for the current invocation
2. effective bundle props `role_models`
3. platform defaults

The overlay does not mutate bundle props or `Config.role_models`; it affects
only model calls made while the context is bound.

Diagram:

```text
configured bundle props
config.role_models
        |
        v
+---------------------------+
| Config.role_models        |
| memory.reconciler=Sonnet  |
+-------------+-------------+
              |
              | request wants a temporary override
              v
+---------------------------+
| bundle_call_context       |
| role_models:              |
|   memory.reconciler=Haiku |
+-------------+-------------+
              |
              v
+---------------------------+
| ModelRouter.describe/get  |
| 1. call-context override  |
| 2. Config.role_models     |
| 3. platform default       |
+-------------+-------------+
              |
              v
current request uses Haiku;
next request falls back to configured Sonnet
unless override is re-applied
```

The overlay follows nested SDK agents, React, in-process tools, and isolated
Docker/Fargate runtimes while the context is bound. It affects SDK model calls
through `ModelServiceBase` / `ModelRouter`, not direct provider clients that
bypass the SDK router.

Communicator behavior in this path:
- if request routing carries an exact socket/stream target, direct peer delivery
  is possible
- otherwise events fan out to all clients connected to the same session room

### 2) REST bundle operation path

Bundle operations invoked by REST currently go through:

`GET|POST /api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/operations/{operation}`

Also available for backward compatibility:

`POST /api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/operations/{operation}`

Relevant code:
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/proc/rest/integrations/integrations.py`

Current flow:
1. REST request resolves `bundle_id`
2. runtime creates `ChatTaskPayload`
3. `get_workflow_instance(...)` creates or reuses the entrypoint
4. proc resolves decorated `@api` alias + method first, then falls back to same-name method lookup for undecorated bundles
5. runtime calls the resolved method with `user_id=..., fingerprint=..., **kwargs`

What the bundle has in this path:
- `self.comm`
- `self.comm_context`
- `self.bundle_props`
- `self.pg_pool` / `self.redis` when available
- the same storage and secret helpers as the chat-turn path

## Local bundle storage helpers

If bundle code needs local filesystem state on the proc instance, use the SDK helper.
The bundle does not choose the physical root. Local development may map this to
a host directory, and cloud deployments may map it to EFS or equivalent shared
storage, but bundle code only sees the runtime-provided bundle storage root and
creates its own subtree below it.

Do not do this:
- build ad hoc paths under the repo checkout
- store mutable runtime state next to bundle source files
- assume the current working directory is durable
- put `file://...`, host absolute paths, or mount paths in bundle props to
  define bundle-local storage

Use the canonical bundle local root:

1. `self.bundle_storage_root()`
- available on bundle entrypoints
- resolves the bundle-scoped shared local storage root for the active tenant/project
- stable by bundle id for the active tenant/project

2. `bundle_storage_dir(...)`
- import from `kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.bundle_storage`
- use it only in lower-level helpers that do not have an entrypoint instance

Typical pattern for mutable local runtime state:

```python
storage_root = self.bundle_storage_root()
local_root = storage_root / "_subsystem_name"
local_root.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

Why this matters:
- local mode uses a dedicated mounted bundle-storage folder
- cloud mode uses the shared instance-visible storage root as well
- the helper gives bundle code the platform-managed location instead of an accidental repo-relative path
- the same bundle code works when the physical storage mapping changes

Use cases for the local helper root:
- cloned repos or working copies
- prepared indexes
- local mirrors
- cron job state
- daily pipeline workspace/cache

Do not confuse this with `BundleArtifactStorage`:
- local helper root = shared instance-local filesystem
- `BundleArtifactStorage` = backend storage API for bundle artifacts

## Guarded shared filesystem objects

If a bundle prepares a shared local object under `bundle_storage_root()` and
multiple requests/workers may try to build it at the same time, guard the build.
This applies in cloud deployments and in local `kdcube start` / docker-compose
runtimes because both can run multiple workers against the same mounted runtime
storage.

Use the low-level observed lock when the bundle owns the signature and readiness
rules:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.storage.observed_file_locks import observed_file_lock


def ensure_local_registry(self) -> pathlib.Path:
    storage_root = self.bundle_storage_root()
    registry_root = storage_root / "registry"
    signature = self.bundle_prop("registry.version", default="local")
    signature_path = storage_root / ".registry.signature"

    def current() -> bool:
        try:
            return (
                signature_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8").strip() == signature
                and (registry_root / "index.json").exists()
            )
        except Exception:
            return False

    if current():
        return registry_root

    with observed_file_lock(
        lock_path=storage_root / ".registry.lock",
        resource_id=f"{self.config.ai_bundle_spec.id}:registry",
        operation="my.bundle.registry.build",
        wait_seconds=300,
    ):
        if current():
            return registry_root

        build_registry(registry_root)
        if not (registry_root / "index.json").exists():
            raise RuntimeError("registry build completed but index.json is missing")
        signature_path.write_text(f"{signature}\n", encoding="utf-8")

    return registry_root
```

Rules:

- check `signature + ready` before the lock so normal reads stay fast
- re-check after acquiring the lock because another worker may have finished
- write the signature only after the output is ready
- use `observed_file_lock_async(...)` from async code that must not block the
  event loop while waiting for the lock
- use a bounded `wait_seconds` so a stuck owner becomes a visible failure

For UI main apps and widgets, use the platform UI build path instead of writing
bundle-local lock code. `BaseEntrypoint` already uses
`run_once_for_shared_bundle_storage(...)` from
`kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.bundle_once` so each UI output has one builder,
waiters, a source signature, and an output readiness check.

Detailed runtime lifecycle:

- [Synchronization Mechanisms](../../service/synch-mechanisms/critical-section-README.md)

## Async props and secrets access

KDCube bundle execution is async. In bundle code, use the awaited secret helpers
as the normal API:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.config import (
    get_secret,
    set_user_secret,
    delete_user_secret,
    set_bundle_secret,
)

deployment_token = await get_secret("b:integrations.telegram.bot_token")
user_token = await get_secret("email.accounts.google_1.tokens")
await set_user_secret("email.accounts.google_1.tokens", token_json)
await delete_user_secret("email.accounts.google_1.tokens")
await set_bundle_secret("integrations.telegram.webhook_secret", webhook_secret)
```

For non-secret deployment config, use `self.bundle_prop("path", default)`.
Use `dict(self.bundle_props or {})` only when a whole effective props snapshot
is required. Do not read secrets from `self.bundle_secrets` or raw descriptor
helpers.

Scope resolution:

- `b:...` resolves through the current bound bundle context
- user-scoped helpers resolve `user_id` and `bundle_id` from the current
  request context unless passed explicitly
- background jobs restore the same request/runtime context snapshot before
  calling bundle code, so job tools can read user-scoped secrets without
  inventing ids in the LLM prompt
- if a bundle entrypoint derives from mixins with background jobs, the final
  `@on_job` method should call `await super().handle_job(**kwargs)` first; mixins
  dispatch by `work_kind` and return `handled=true` when they consumed the job

- do not call `get_secrets_manager(...).get_secret(...)` directly from bundle
  or feature code

Provider behavior:

- `secrets-service` uses native async HTTP calls
- in-memory secrets are immediate
- file-backed and AWS SM providers expose async helper methods through a
  compatibility offload because their current storage, Redis-lock, and boto
  clients are sync internally
- the public bundle contract is still async: callers should `await` the helper
  instead of blocking the event loop directly

## AWS and IAM scoping

Bundles run in the same processor process, so AWS identity must be scoped by
the boto client/session that performs the operation. Do not treat a bundle
configuration value such as `aws_profile` as a process-wide IAM context.

Best practice:

- create explicit `boto3.Session(...)` / `aioboto3.Session(...)` objects for
  bundle-specific AWS work
- pass `profile_name`, `region_name`, or assumed-role credentials into that
  session/client explicitly
- keep those sessions local to the operation or bundle component that needs
  them
- do not call `boto3.setup_default_session(...)` from bundle code
- do not mutate `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, or related
  process environment variables at runtime

Why this matters:

- a scoped `boto3.Session(profile_name="...")` does not change other bundles
- direct `boto3.client(...)` calls use the process default credential chain
- platform SDK helpers use their own configuration, not arbitrary bundle props
- a later bundle-specific session does not re-scope clients already created by
  another bundle or by the platform

`BundleArtifactStorage` is platform storage. It uses its explicit `storage_uri` or
the platform `KDCUBE_STORAGE_PATH` / `settings.STORAGE_PATH`. Bundle-specific
props such as `my_feature.aws_profile` do not automatically apply to
`BundleArtifactStorage`. If a bundle needs artifact storage under a non-default AWS
identity, pass storage configuration explicitly through the storage API or add a
bundle-owned storage wrapper that constructs the backend with an explicit
profile/region.

Important current communicator rule for REST operations:
- communicator is available
- if the request carries the `KDC-Stream-ID` HTTP header, configurable via
  `STREAM_ID_HEADER_NAME`, meaning the header
  that identifies the connected peer/stream which issued the request, the
  runtime maps that value into `routing.socket_id`
- that lets communicator target the initiating SSE / Socket.IO peer directly
- if the header is absent, the request remains session-scoped

Practical consequence:
- with the `KDC-Stream-ID` peer-identification header, peer-to-peer delivery is
  possible
- without it, all clients listening on that session receive the event
- if nobody is listening on that session, nobody receives it

If the bundle also ships widget or frontend code, that code must follow the
client transport contract when it calls `/api/integrations/*`:

- [bundle-client-communication-README.md](bundle-client-communication-README.md)

### 3) Tool execution in normal in-process runtime

Bundle tools and SDK tools are loaded by `ToolSubsystem`.

Relevant code:
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/runtime/tool_subsystem.py`
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/runtime/tool_module_bindings.py`

What happens:
1. `tools_descriptor.py` is passed into `create_tool_subsystem_with_mcp(...)`
2. `ToolSubsystem` resolves `module` / `ref` entries
3. each tool module is loaded
4. runtime binds service/integrations/registry centrally
5. tool functions are called through `agent_io_tools.tool_call(...)`

What tool modules get:

| Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `_SERVICE` / `SERVICE` | model service |
| `model_service` | same service under an explicit alias |
| `_INTEGRATIONS` / `INTEGRATIONS` | integration map |
| `_TOOL_SUBSYSTEM` / `TOOL_SUBSYSTEM` | active `ToolSubsystem` |
| `_COMMUNICATOR` / `COMMUNICATOR` | current communicator |
| `_KV_CACHE` / `KV_CACHE` | KV cache |
| `_CTX_CLIENT` / `CTX_CLIENT` | context retrieval client |
| `REGISTRY` | workflow-provided registry |

Current `INTEGRATIONS` contents are:
- `ctx_client`
- `kv_cache`
- `tool_subsystem`

Reusable helper:

- `kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.bundle_tool_context.scope()` returns the
  current tenant, project, bundle id, bundle user scope, user type,
  conversation/turn ids, bundle props, storage root, output/work dirs, and
  `bundle_call_context`.
- The returned `user_id` is the bundle user scope. It is not guaranteed to be a
  KDCube account id; public integrations may resolve stable external identities.
- Use `bundle_call_context` for runtime ids that tools need but the model should
  not provide, such as task id, execution id, job metadata, or provider context.
- `kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.bundle_tool_context.host_files(...)`
  hosts current-turn files through the active conversation store and returns the
  strict `artifact_type: "files"` result payload. Use it only from trusted
  bundle/catalog tools after the file has been written or materialized.
- `host_files(...)` requires prepared tool context: an active `ToolSubsystem`
  with a hosting service, communicator scope for tenant/project/user/
  conversation/turn, conversation storage, and a readable output directory.
  `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)` prepares this for normal tool calls, and
  `BaseWorkflow.rebind_request_context(...)` refreshes it for cached workflow
  instances.
- if that context is not prepared, `host_files(...)` raises a runtime error such
  as `tools are not bound to the current tool subsystem`,
  `tool hosting service is unavailable`, `tool communicator is unavailable`, or
  `bundle storage root is unavailable`.

### 4) Tool execution in isolated runtime

When policy or tool runtime sends execution into isolated runtime, the tool
module is not executed in the main process.

Relevant code:
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/runtime/bootstrap.py`
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/runtime/iso_runtime.py`
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/runtime/isolated/py_code_exec_entry.py`

What happens:
1. host runtime serializes a portable spec
2. child runtime restores env and selected `ContextVar` state
3. model service, registry, communicator, and integrations are reconstructed
4. runtime rebuilds the tool subsystem from exported runtime globals
5. tool modules are loaded and bound with the same canonical names
6. the trusted runtime rebuilds conversation hosting from runtime storage
   settings and attaches it to the isolated `ToolSubsystem`
7. `bootstrap_bind_all(...)` is the SDK utility that performs this isolated
   runtime preparation; custom isolated runners must call it or provide an
   equivalent prepared tool context before trusted tools can call
   `host_files(...)`

Important:
- isolated execution does not inherit arbitrary live Python objects
- it receives a reconstructed narrow runtime contract
- tool code should therefore rely on the documented bound surfaces, not on
  random global host state
- generated executor code should call catalog tools through
  `agent_io_tools.tool_call(...)` when it needs trusted capabilities such as
  mailbox access, file materialization, or `host_files(...)`

## Communicator rules

Communicator is the same core chat communicator used by the rest of the chat
infrastructure.

Relevant code:
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/emitters.py`
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/ingress/sse/chat.py`
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/ingress/socketio/chat.py`

Current routing rules:
- if communicator has `target_sid`, a direct peer event can be delivered to one
  SSE stream / socket
- otherwise events are broadcast to the whole session room

That is why:
- queued chat turns can target one client when the request path carried that
  identity
- REST bundle operations can target one client when the `KDC-Stream-ID` header,
  which identifies the connected peer, is carried with the HTTP request;
  otherwise they broadcast to the session room

For actual event names, `chat.delta` shape, and built-in markers such as
`answer`, `thinking`, `canvas`, `timeline_text`, and `subsystem`, read:

- [bundle-chat-stream-events-README.md](bundle-chat-stream-events-README.md)

For recording selected comm events into a bounded buffer and sending the batch
to a bundle/platform sink, read:

- [bundle-event-recording-and-sinks-README.md](bundle-event-recording-and-sinks-README.md)

## Shared browser, cache, and retrieval from tools

These are the main non-model integrations commonly used by tools:

### KV cache

Read from:
- `_KV_CACHE`
- or `(_INTEGRATIONS or {}).get("kv_cache")`

Use it for:
- small distributed caches
- deduplication flags
- short-lived shared state

### Context retrieval client

Read from:
- `_CTX_CLIENT`
- or `(_INTEGRATIONS or {}).get("ctx_client")`

Use it for:
- context/timeline retrieval
- retrieval-backed tool behavior

### Shared browser

Shared browser is not injected as a bound global. Use the standard shared
service directly:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.rendering.shared_browser import get_shared_browser

browser = await get_shared_browser()
```

This is the same browser service used by rendering-oriented SDK tools.

## Practical rules

- Entry point code should use `self.comm`, `self.comm_context`, bundle props,
  secrets, and bundle storage helpers.
- In async entrypoints, APIs, hooks, cron handlers, `@on_job`, and tools, use
  `await get_secret(...)`, `await set_user_secret(...)`, and
  `await delete_user_secret(...)`.
- Tool modules should use the centrally bound runtime globals rather than trying
  to reconstruct runtime state themselves.
- Use `get_comm()` or `_COMMUNICATOR` when a tool needs chat-side event
  emission.
- If you want a REST-triggered bundle/tool event to reach the initiating peer
  only, make sure the request carries the `KDC-Stream-ID` header for that
  connected peer.
- Assume isolated runtime reconstructs only the documented portable contract.
