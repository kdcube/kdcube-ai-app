# SDK Events Subsystem

The SDK events subsystem provides shared event-source identity and discovery.
ReAct is the first consumer, but the model is wider than ReAct: the same source
identity can describe tool calls, external UI events, authored external events,
and future event-producing SDK surfaces.

## Core Model

An event source has two identities:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event_source_id` | Stable semantic source key, such as `web_tools.web_search`, `react.followup`, or `bundle.wizard.field_changed`. |
| `event_id` | One occurrence of that source. For tool-backed events this is the tool call id. |

A tool call is the first implemented special case of an event source:

```text
tool_id      == event_source_id
tool_call_id == event_id
```

The tool still executes through the normal tool subsystem. Event-source metadata
only tells downstream consumers how to validate, produce, project, announce, or
compact the occurrence.

## Declaration

Event sources are declared with `@event_source(...)` or returned from
`list_event_sources()` / explicit event-spec modules.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import event_source

@event_source(
    event_source_id="{alias}.search",
    policies=[
        {
            "react_phase": "block_production",
            "event_policy_id": "react.block_production.generic_result_item",
        },
    ],
    kind="react.tool",
    reactive=False,
)
async def search(...):
    ...
```

Policy bindings are consumer-specific. Today the supported consumer is ReAct,
so bindings use `react_phase` and `event_policy_id`. The shared SDK events
subsystem does not define ReAct timeline behavior by itself.

For non-tool external events, the declaration can also define ReAct admission
defaults:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import event_source_declaration

def list_event_sources():
    return [
        event_source_declaration(
            event_source_id="my_app.wizard.assistance.requested",
            kind="react.external",
            reactive=True,
            iteration_credit=2,
            policies=[
                {
                    "react_phase": "timeline_projection",
                    "event_policy_id": "my_app.timeline_projection.wizard_event",
                },
            ],
        )
    ]
```

`reactive` is declaration metadata/default for code that authors occurrences of
this source. Transported `external_event` occurrences must still carry their
effective `payload.external_event.routing.reactive` value; the runtime does not
silently wake ReAct from a declaration alone. `iteration_credit` is the default
live-turn credit for one occurrence that is explicitly reactive. A client
occurrence may override credit with
`payload.external_event.routing.iteration_credit`; runtime caps always apply
last.

## Discovery

`EventSourceSubsystem` discovers event declarations from:

- loaded tool modules;
- explicit event source modules;
- declarations returned by `list_event_sources()`;
- first-party built-in ReAct event modules.

The subsystem validates duplicate `event_source_id` values and lets consumers
look up declarations by source id or, when a durable block carries
`event_source_id`, by block.

## Artifact Namespace Rehosters

The same module discovery path can register artifact namespace rehosters. A
rehoster is different from an event source: it turns a custom namespace
artifact URI such as `ext:...` into a normal ReAct `fi:` artifact ref by
copying bytes into the current turn artifact surface. The rehoster owns the
mapping from the custom URI to the ReAct artifact namespace.

A rehoster must be aware of the ReAct workspace and artifact surfaces. It does
not merely download bytes; it chooses where the artifact belongs in the ReAct
model and returns the resulting `fi:` logical path plus `OUTPUT_DIR`-relative
physical path. Read
[Agent Workspace Collaboration](../agents/react/agent-workspace-collboration-README.md)
and [Files vs Outputs](../agents/react/files-vs-outputs-README.md) before
writing a bundle rehoster.

### Where rehosters are discovered

`@artifact_namespace_rehoster` is discovered only from modules that are loaded
into the ReAct `EventSourceSubsystem`. There are two normal bundle paths:

1. A tool module listed in `tools_descriptor.py`.
2. An event module listed in `events_descriptor.py` and passed to
   `BaseWorkflow.build_react(..., event_source_specs=...)`.

Tool modules are scanned automatically because `ToolSubsystem` builds
`EventSourceSubsystem` from its loaded tool modules. Event-only modules are
loaded from `event_source_specs`; a descriptor file by itself is not scanned
unless the workflow passes those specs into `build_react`.

Bundle shape:

```text
my.bundle@1-0/
  tools_descriptor.py
  events_descriptor.py
  events/
    my_artifacts.py
  orchestrator/
    workflow.py
```

`events_descriptor.py`:

```python
EVENT_SOURCE_SPECS = [
    {"ref": "events/my_artifacts.py", "alias": "my_artifacts"},
]
```

Workflow handoff:

```python
from .. import events_descriptor, tools_descriptor

react = self.build_react(
    scratchpad,
    mod_tools_spec=tools_descriptor.TOOLS_SPECS,
    event_source_specs=events_descriptor.EVENT_SOURCE_SPECS,
)
```

Inside `events/my_artifacts.py`:

- snapshot-like state should materialize as `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/...`
- external evidence/files should materialize as
  `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<name>`
- editable workspace/project state should materialize as
  `fi:turn_<id>.files/...`
- produced deliverables/reports should materialize as `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/...`

The destination is semantic:

| Source artifact meaning | ReAct destination |
|---|---|
| Story/wizard state snapshot | `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/<path>` / `turn_<id>/snapshots/<path>` |
| Evidence or domain attachment | `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<name>` / `turn_<id>/external/<event_kind>/attachments/<event_id>/<name>` |
| Editable project/workspace file | `fi:turn_<id>.files/<workspace_scope>/<path>` / `turn_<id>/files/<workspace_scope>/<path>` |
| Produced report/export/rendered artifact | `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/<artifact_scope>/<path>` / `turn_<id>/outputs/<artifact_scope>/<path>` |

The returned paths are the agent contract. After `react.pull(paths=["ext:..."])`,
the agent should use the returned `logical_path` or `physical_path`; it should
not derive a replacement path from the external URI.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import artifact_namespace_rehoster

@artifact_namespace_rehoster(
    namespace="ext",
    description="Materialize external artifact refs for ReAct tools.",
)
async def rehost_external_ref(*, ref, key, ctx_browser, outdir, **context):
    ...
    return {
        "materialized": [{
            "source_ref": ref,
            "logical_path": "fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/ext/path.yaml",
            "physical_path": "turn_<id>/snapshots/ext/path.yaml",
        }]
    }
```

The same module can also expose an explicit list when it does not want the
subsystem to scan all top-level objects:

```python
def list_artifact_namespace_rehosters():
    return [rehost_external_ref]
```

`react.pull` calls registered rehosters before the normal `fi:` hydration path.
A registered rehoster is required for each external namespace. This keeps custom
namespace artifact URIs such as `ext:...` explicit on the timeline while giving
agents a standard way to materialize them when they need the actual file. The
pull result is the contract consumed by the agent: it includes the source ref
and the resolved/rehosted `logical_path` / `physical_path` rows to use next.

## Boundary

The shared events subsystem owns:

- event-source declarations;
- identity naming;
- source discovery;
- policy binding lookup.
- artifact namespace rehoster discovery.

It does not own:

- transport delivery;
- queueing or turn ownership;
- processor wakeup resolution;
- final renderer block shapes;
- ReAct cache marker placement;
- ANNOUNCE text formatting.

Those remain responsibilities of the consuming runtime. For ReAct, see the
event-source phase documents under `docs/sdk/agents/react/event-source/`.
For conversation-scoped authored events that arrive through chat ingress, see
[External Events](external-events-README.md).
