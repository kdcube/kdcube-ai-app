# SDK Events Subsystem

The SDK events subsystem provides shared event-source identity and discovery.
ReAct is the first consumer, but the model is wider than ReAct: the same source
identity can describe tool calls, conversation-scoped UI/user/domain events,
and future event-producing SDK surfaces.

## Core Model

An event source has two identities:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event_source_id` | Stable semantic source key, such as `web_tools.web_search`, `react.message`, `react.followup`, or `bundle.wizard.field_changed`. |
| `event_id` | One occurrence of that source. For tool-backed events this is the tool call id. |

A tool call is the first implemented special case of an event source:

```text
tool_id      == event_source_id
tool_call_id == event_id
```

The tool still executes through the normal tool subsystem. Event-source metadata
only tells downstream consumers how to validate, produce, project, announce, or
compact the occurrence.

`event_source_declaration.kind` classifies the occurrence family. It does not
make a callable visible to the model by itself.

| `kind` | Meaning | Agent-visible tool? |
|---|---|---:|
| `react.tool` | ReAct tool-call lifecycle source. The occurrence is a tool call/result; `event_source_id` normally equals the tool id. | Yes, only when the callable is also loaded as a tool, for example through `@kernel_function`. |
| `react.event_source_reader` | Owner-domain reader that resolves a canonical namespace ref for runtime/policy code. Model-facing exact content access should use `react.pull` through a namespace rehoster. | No |
| `react.external` | Authored external event from UI, integration, Data Bus, or another bundle surface. Reactivity is an occurrence property on transported `external_events[]`. | No |
| `react.native_tool.write` / `react.native_tool.source` | Built-in ReAct-native source families such as write/source-pool handling. | Runtime-owned |

Keep this distinction strict. A source can have policy bindings without being a
tool. For example, canvas board resolution may have a `canvas.read` source with
`kind="react.event_source_reader"` for runtime/policy use, while exact
model-facing board content is imported through `react.pull(paths=["cnv:main@7"])`.
The write source `canvas.patch` remains `kind="react.tool"` because the agent
calls `canvas.patch(...)` directly.

Event-source policy bindings are the integration contract. For ReAct, a source
can declare policies that find result surfaces, convert them to timeline
blocks, project those blocks for model-visible rendering, append ANNOUNCE tail
material, or prepare compaction views. The shared SDK events subsystem only
discovers and names those policies; it does not itself render timeline text or
generate file previews.

Authored conversation events use the same source/occurrence model. Their
accepted transport envelope is documented in
[External Event Envelope](external-event-envelope-README.md). In that envelope,
`event_source_id` selects policies, `event_id` identifies the occurrence, and
`logical_path` is the `ev:` path of the event object on the turn timeline.
User prompts, user attachments, followups, and steers are built-in external
event types (`event.user.prompt`, `event.user.attachment.*`,
`event.user.followup`, `event.user.steer`) and should be authored through the
same plural `external_events[]` protocol as bundle/domain events.

## Declaration

Event sources are declared with `@event_source(...)` or returned from
`list_event_sources()` / explicit event-spec modules.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import event_source

@event_source(
    event_source_id="{alias}.search",
    policies=[
        {
            "react_phase": "block_production",
            "event_policy_id": "react.block_production.generic_result_item",
        },
    ],
    kind="react.tool",
    reactive=False,
)
async def search(...):
    ...
```

Policy bindings are consumer-specific. Today the supported consumer is ReAct,
so bindings use `react_phase` and `event_policy_id`. The shared SDK events
subsystem does not define ReAct timeline behavior by itself.

For non-tool event sources, the declaration can also define ReAct admission
defaults:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import event_source_declaration

def list_event_sources():
    return [
        event_source_declaration(
            event_source_id="my_app.wizard.assistance.requested",
            kind="react.external",
            reactive=True,
            iteration_credit=2,
            policies=[
                {
                    "react_phase": "timeline_projection",
                    "event_policy_id": "my_app.timeline_projection.wizard_event",
                },
            ],
        )
    ]
```

`reactive` is declaration metadata/default for code that authors occurrences of
this source. Transported external-event occurrences must still carry their
effective `external_events[].reactive` value; the runtime does not
silently wake ReAct from a declaration alone. `iteration_credit` is the default
live-turn credit for one occurrence that is explicitly reactive. An accepted
occurrence may override the declaration default with an occurrence-level credit
field; runtime caps always apply last.

## Discovery

`EventSourceSubsystem` discovers event declarations from:

- loaded tool modules;
- explicit event source modules;
- declarations returned by `list_event_sources()`;
- first-party built-in ReAct event modules.

The subsystem validates duplicate `event_source_id` values and lets consumers
look up declarations by source id or, when a durable block carries
`event_source_id`, by block.

Tool visibility and event visibility are intentionally separate:

| Visibility | How it is loaded | What it grants |
|---|---|---|
| Tool visibility | resolved agent tool specs | The model can call the tool. Tool modules are also scanned for their event declarations because tool calls produce events. |
| Event visibility | `event_source_specs` / explicit event modules | The runtime can discover event sources, policies, event-source readers, and namespace rehosters. It does not make any callable visible to the model. |

The two inputs are cumulative. Passing `event_source_specs` to
`BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)` adds event-only modules to the event subsystem;
it does not replace declarations discovered from loaded tool modules. Use this
when a bundle needs a namespace rehoster such as `cnv:` or `mem:` without
exposing the namespace owner's tools.

## Event Source Readers

An event source reader is the owner-domain hook for resolving canonical refs. It
is used by runtime/policy code when a ref names an object whose current
representation is owned by an event domain, for example `mem:mem_...`.

The reader resolves the ref. It does not decide how the resolved object should
look on the timeline. The event source's block-production policies render the
resolved payload into blocks.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import event_source_reader

@event_source_reader(
    namespace="mem",
    event_source_id="{alias}.read_memory",
    description="Read a durable memory by mem: ref.",
)
async def read_memory_event_ref(*, ref, ctx_browser=None, **context):
    ...
```

Runtime flow:

```text
runtime code asks EventSourceSubsystem to resolve "mem:mem_123"
  -> EventSourceSubsystem.event_source_reader_for_ref("mem:mem_123")
  -> owner reader resolves the ref
  -> event_source_id selects source policies
  -> block_production policies emit model-visible blocks
```

This keeps owner-domain policy rendering generic. ReAct does not implement
memory, task, canvas, or knowledge-source semantics itself; it relies on the
namespace owner's reader/policies when runtime code needs owner payloads.
Model-facing exact content access is different: use `react.pull` with a
namespace rehoster, then inspect the returned `fi:` artifact.

Readers are discovered from the same loaded tool/event modules as event
sources:

- decorated callables with `@event_source_reader(...)`;
- callables or declaration dictionaries returned from
  `list_event_source_readers()`.

Each namespace can have one local reader in the current `EventSourceSubsystem`.
Duplicate namespace registrations are rejected during discovery.

## Artifact Namespace Rehosters

The same module discovery path can register artifact namespace rehosters. A
rehoster is different from an event source: it turns an external owner ref such
as `cnv:...` or `mem:...` into a normal ReAct `fi:` artifact ref by copying
bytes into the current turn artifact surface. The rehoster owns the mapping from
the owner ref to the ReAct artifact namespace.

A rehoster must be aware of the ReAct workspace and artifact surfaces. It does
not merely download bytes; it chooses where the artifact belongs in the ReAct
model and returns the resulting `fi:` logical path plus `OUTPUT_DIR`-relative
physical path. Read
[Agent Workspace Collaboration](../agents/react/agent-workspace-collboration-README.md)
and [Files vs Outputs](../agents/react/files-vs-outputs-README.md) before
writing a bundle rehoster.

### Where rehosters are discovered

`@artifact_namespace_rehoster` is discovered only from modules that are loaded
into the ReAct `EventSourceSubsystem`. There are two normal bundle paths:

1. A tool module resolved from `surfaces.as_consumer`.
2. An event module passed to
   `BaseWorkflow.build_react(..., event_source_specs=...)`.

Tool modules are scanned automatically because `ToolSubsystem` builds
`EventSourceSubsystem` from its loaded tool modules. Event-only modules are
loaded from `event_source_specs`; a descriptor file by itself is not scanned
unless the workflow passes those specs into `build_react`.

Do not add a module to an agent tool list only to make `react.pull` understand one
of its namespaces. Put the namespace rehoster in an event module and load that
module through `event_source_specs`.

Bundle shape:

```text
my.bundle@1-0/
  consumer_surfaces.py
  events/
    my_artifacts.py
  orchestrator/
    workflow.py
```

Workflow handoff:

```python
event_source_specs = [
    {"ref": "events/my_artifacts.py", "alias": "my_artifacts"},
]

react = self.build_react(
    scratchpad,
    mod_tools_spec=tool_config.tool_specs,
    event_source_specs=event_source_specs,
)
```

Inside `events/my_artifacts.py`:

- snapshot-like state should materialize as `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/...`
- external evidence/files should materialize as
  `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<name>`
- editable workspace/project state should materialize as
  `fi:turn_<id>.files/...`
- produced deliverables/reports should materialize as `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/...`

The destination is semantic:

| Source artifact meaning | ReAct destination |
|---|---|
| Story/wizard state snapshot | `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/<path>` / `turn_<id>/snapshots/<path>` |
| Evidence or domain attachment | `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<name>` / `turn_<id>/external/<event_kind>/attachments/<event_id>/<name>` |
| Editable project/workspace file | `fi:turn_<id>.files/<workspace_scope>/<path>` / `turn_<id>/files/<workspace_scope>/<path>` |
| Produced report/export/rendered artifact | `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/<artifact_scope>/<path>` / `turn_<id>/outputs/<artifact_scope>/<path>` |

The returned paths are the agent contract. After
`react.pull(paths=["cnv:main@7"])`, the agent should use the returned
`logical_path` or `physical_path`; it should not derive a replacement path from
the owner ref.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import artifact_namespace_rehoster

@artifact_namespace_rehoster(
    namespace="cnv",
    description="Materialize canvas refs for ReAct tools.",
)
async def rehost_canvas_ref(*, ref, key, ctx_browser, outdir, **context):
    ...
    return {
        "materialized": [{
            "source_ref": ref,
            "logical_path": "fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/cnv/main.json",
            "physical_path": "turn_<id>/snapshots/cnv/main.json",
        }]
    }
```

The same module can also expose an explicit list when it does not want the
subsystem to scan all top-level objects:

```python
def list_artifact_namespace_rehosters():
    return [rehost_canvas_ref]
```

`react.pull` calls registered rehosters before the normal `fi:` hydration path.
A registered rehoster is required for each external owner namespace that should
be importable into ReAct. This keeps owner refs such as `cnv:...` and `mem:...`
explicit on the timeline while giving agents a standard way to materialize exact
content when needed. The pull result is the contract consumed by the agent: it
includes the source ref and the resolved/rehosted `logical_path` /
`physical_path` rows to use next.

## File Rows And Preview Text

For ReAct, file-producing event sources usually integrate by declaring
block-production policies that produce file rows:

- `artifact_rows`
- `declared_file_items`
- `hosted_artifacts`

Those rows let the shared ReAct artifact builders preserve logical paths,
hosted refs, physical paths, MIME, size, and other artifact metadata. They do
not automatically imply that the file body is copied into model-visible text.

A source should provide `text_preview` only when it already has the bytes and
can create a bounded, source-owned preview during block production. Exec does
this for text files produced in the isolated runtime. Other sources can stay
metadata-only; ReAct can later call `react.read(paths=["fi:..."])` on the
visible logical artifact path when exact content is needed.

If a source emits a pre-rendered file preview block, the block should carry:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "projection": {
      "phase": "block_production",
      "format": "text_file_preview.v1",
      "already_rendered": true
    }
  }
}
```

That marker tells ReAct timeline rendering not to wrap or line-number the same
preview a second time.

## Boundary

The shared events subsystem owns:

- event-source declarations;
- identity naming;
- source discovery;
- policy binding lookup.
- artifact namespace rehoster discovery.

It does not own:

- transport delivery;
- queueing or turn ownership;
- processor wakeup resolution;
- final renderer block shapes;
- ReAct cache marker placement;
- ANNOUNCE text formatting.

Those remain responsibilities of the consuming runtime. For ReAct, see the
event-source phase documents under `docs/sdk/agents/react/event-source/`.
For conversation-scoped events that arrive through chat ingress, see
[External Events](external-events-README.md).
