# Widget Integration

SDK widgets can consume the shared TypeScript packages without publishing to an
external npm registry. App UI config declares `shared_sources`; the app build
materializes those sources next to the widget and Vite aliases imports to the
materialized copy.

```text
app UI config
  src_folder: sdk://solutions/chat/ui/widget
  shared_sources:
    components_core: npm://components-core/src
    components_react: npm://components-react/src
        |
        v
build workspace
  widget source
  _shared/components_core
  _shared/components_react
        |
        v
Vite aliases
  @kdcube/components-core  -> _shared/components_core
  @kdcube/components-react -> _shared/components_react
```

## Current Chat Widget

Use the helper for new app code:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.chat import chat_widget_ui_config

widgets = {
    "workspace_chat": chat_widget_ui_config(),
}
```

The current default is the package UI path. It materializes
`@kdcube/components-core` and `@kdcube/components-react` through `npm://` and builds
the widget with the package-backed chat engine/UI.

Inline config can express the same thing:

```yaml
workspace_chat:
  enabled: true
  src_folder: sdk://solutions/chat/ui/widget
  engine: package-ui
```

During build, `engine: package-ui` expands to the concrete Vite environment and
shared sources. App authors should prefer the helper or the `engine` field instead
of hand-writing build commands.

## Shared Sources

`shared_sources` can point at:

| Scheme | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sdk://...` | Source inside the SDK tree. |
| `npm://components-core/src` | Source inside the shipped npm package workspace. |
| `npm://components-react/src` | React package source. |
| `bundle://...` | Source relative to the app source root. |
| absolute/relative path | Explicit source path for local development or unusual layouts. |

The build copies each source into `_shared/<name>` unless a target is supplied.
Only source files are copied; `node_modules` remains local to the widget build.

## Runtime Image Requirement

The npm package workspace ships inside the installed app tree at:

```text
app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/npm/packages
```

In the runtime image this resolves to `/app/npm/packages`. Any widget using
`npm://...` requires an image built from a revision that includes that tree.

## Scene And Canvas Widgets

Widgets that mount scene or canvas UI should consume the scoped package sources
they actually need:

```yaml
main_view:
  src_folder: bundle://ui/main
  build_command: npm install --no-package-lock && OUTDIR=<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH> npm run build
  shared_sources:
    components_core_scene:
      src_folder: npm://components-core/src/scene
    components_core_events:
      src_folder: npm://components-core/src/events
    components_core_canvas:
      src_folder: npm://components-core/src/canvas
    components_react_canvas:
      src_folder: npm://components-react/src/canvas
```

This keeps widgets from reaching into another app's private UI code.

## Boundaries

- A widget may import shared contracts and UI from the npm packages.
- A widget must get runtime config from the app/scene host, not from package globals.
- A widget declares event subscriptions itself through the events client; the host
  should not invent hidden subscriptions for it.
- A widget can emit `kdcube.canvas.ingress`; the scene/host decides which board
  receives it.
- A widget can ask for object actions through host/resolver callbacks; it must not
  hardcode namespace behavior.
