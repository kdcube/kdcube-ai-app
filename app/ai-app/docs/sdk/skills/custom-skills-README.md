# Custom Skills (Bundle‑Local)

This is a quick guide to defining **bundle‑local skills**.

Bundle-local skills are only one discovery layer. The registry also loads core
SDK skills and SDK solution skills, such as `task.tasks` and `task.job` from
the reusable tasks solution.

For full details, see:
- [docs/sdk/skills/skills-README.md](skills-README.md)
- [docs/sdk/skills/skills-infra-README.md](skills-infra-README.md)

---

## Minimal pattern

1. Create a skills folder in your bundle.
2. Add a `skills_descriptor.py` to register skills.
3. Use `AGENTS_CONFIG` to decide which core, solution, and bundle-local skills
   each agent can see.

Example bundle:
- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/react@2026-02-10-02-44`

Files:
- `skills/product`
- `skills_descriptor.py`

---

## What a skill can include

Inside a skill folder you can include:
- `SKILL.md` (required) with front‑matter fields:
  - `name`, `id`, `description`, `version`, `namespace`, `tags`, `when_to_use`, `imports`
  - `agent_disclosure` (optional): set to `hidden` for operational guidance that can be loaded by exact id but must not be advertised in the skill catalog
- `compact.md` (optional): compact instruction variant
- `sources.yaml` (optional): sources injected into `sources_pool` when the skill is loaded
- `tools.yaml` (optional): recommended or required tools for the skill

Both `SKILL.md` and `skill.yml` are supported.

---

## Descriptor example

```python
# skills_descriptor.py
import pathlib

BUNDLE_ROOT = pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent

# Bundle-local skills root (expected layout: <root>/<namespace>/<skill_id>/SKILL.md)
CUSTOM_SKILLS_ROOT = BUNDLE_ROOT / "skills"

AGENTS_CONFIG = {
    # Exact consumer id match
    "solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong": {
        # Explicit allow-list (fully qualified skill ids)
        "enabled": [
            "product.kdcube",
        ]
    },

    # Agent-specific overrides (use the agent id)
    "answer.generator.strong": {
        # Example: disable a namespace for this agent only
        "disabled": ["public.*"],
    },
}
```

SDK solution skills do not need a bundle `CUSTOM_SKILLS_ROOT`. They are already
discoverable by the SDK registry. A bundle enables or hides them with
`AGENTS_CONFIG` just like core SDK and bundle-local skills:

```python
AGENTS_CONFIG = {
    "solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong": {
        "enabled": [
            "public.*",
            "task.tasks",
        ]
    },
    "solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular": {
        "enabled": [
            "public.*",
            "task.tasks",
        ]
    },
}
```

A saved-job bundle entry can use a separate `job_skills_descriptor.py` with the
same consumer ids but a different allowed set:

```python
AGENTS_CONFIG = {
    "solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong": {
        "enabled": [
            "public.*",
            "task.job",
        ]
    },
    "solver.react.v2.decision.v2.regular": {
        "enabled": [
            "public.*",
            "task.job",
        ]
    },
}
```

If the skill tells the agent to use tools, the bundle must also expose the
matching tool module. For the tasks solution, that means registering
`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.tasks.tools` and/or
`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.tasks.job_tools` in the bundle tool
descriptor.

If a skill is meaningless or misleading without specific tools, mark those
tool refs as required in the skill's `tools.yaml`:

```yaml
tools:
  - id: memory.search_memory
    role: durable memory read
    required: true
  - id: memory.record_memory
    role: durable memory write
    required: true
```

Required tool refs are evaluated against the active tool catalog for the current
agent/turn. If any required tool is unavailable, the skill is skipped from the
catalog, `SKx` short ids, imports, and `react.read(sk:...)`. Optional tool refs
remain documentation only.

When a parent skill imports a required-tool skill, keep the optional subsystem
instructions inside the imported skill. Do not duplicate those tool-specific
steps in the parent body, because the registry can skip an ineligible import
but it cannot rewrite arbitrary text inside a different skill.

### Important: `CUSTOM_SKILLS_ROOT = None` does not currently disable bundle-local skills

Today, the runtime auto-detects `<bundle_root>/skills` when `custom_skills_root` is
missing/falsy. That means setting `CUSTOM_SKILLS_ROOT = None` in
`skills_descriptor.py` does **not** reliably switch off bundle-local skills.

Practical options today:
- Remove or rename the bundle `skills/` folder.
- Set `CUSTOM_SKILLS_ROOT` to a truthy non-existent path (prevents auto-discovery fallback).
- Use `AGENTS_CONFIG` to hide skills from specific agents (visibility filter, not registry disable).

### Hiding a loadable skill from skill self-description

`AGENTS_CONFIG` controls whether a skill is available to a consumer at all.
Sometimes a bundle also needs operational guidance that is available to the
agent but must not be listed when the user asks "what skills do you have?".

Use `agent_disclosure: hidden` in the skill front matter:

```yaml
---
name: user-memory-journal
description: Operational guidance for durable memory tools.
namespace: product
agent_disclosure: hidden
---
```

Runtime behavior:
- The skill remains loadable by exact id, for example `sk:product.user-memory-journal`.
- The skill is omitted from the visible skill catalog and from `SK1`, `SK2`, ...
  short-id mapping.
- If the skill is explicitly loaded, the active skill block uses a redacted
  heading plus a non-disclosure rule. It does not print the skill id/name in the
  prompt-visible skill header.

This is prompt-disclosure control, not authorization. Use `AGENTS_CONFIG` to
disable a skill for an agent that should not be able to load it at all.

---

## Sources + tools metadata

Skills can include:
- `sources.yaml` — sources added to the **sources_pool** when the skill is loaded (via `react.read`).
- `tools.yaml` — tools recommended for this skill (used by planners/UX), plus
  optional `required: true` gates for tools that must exist before the skill is
  safe to expose.

When a skill is loaded with `react.read("sk:<skill>")`, its sources are merged into
`sources_pool` and can be referenced as `so:sources_pool[...]`. Citation tokens inside
skill text are rewritten to match the merged source IDs.

---

## AGENTS_CONFIG visibility filtering (per-agent)

`AGENTS_CONFIG` controls skill visibility by consumer id (agent role). This is
not a global disable of the skills registry. It applies to all discovered skill
roots: core SDK skills, SDK solution skills, and bundle-local skills.

Rules:
- Match is exact by consumer id (example: `solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong`).
- Missing consumer entry means no filter for that consumer.
- `enabled` means allow-list.
- `disabled` means deny-list.
- Wildcards are supported (`public.*`, `public.docx-*`, `*`).
- `"default"` key is not special in current runtime.
- `enabled: []` does not disable all.

Quick disable patterns:
- One skill: `disabled: ["product.kdcube"]`
- Namespace: `disabled: ["public.*"]`
- Task solution skills when the bundle does not expose task tools:
  `disabled: ["task.*"]`
- All for one consumer: `disabled: ["*"]`

Resolution example:

```python
AGENTS_CONFIG = {
    "solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong": {"disabled": ["public.*"]},
    "answer.generator.strong": {"enabled": ["product.kdcube", "public.docx-press"]},
}
```

With registry:
- `product.kdcube`
- `task.tasks`
- `public.docx-press`
- `public.pdf-press`
- `custom.ops-runbook`

Result:
- `consumer="solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong"` -> `product.kdcube`, `task.tasks`, `custom.ops-runbook`
- `consumer="answer.generator.strong"` -> `product.kdcube`, `public.docx-press`
- `consumer="answer.generator.regular"` -> all skills

Where this is applied:
- ReAct decision catalog (`consumer="solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong"`).
- `react.read` skill resolution (`SKx` / `sk:<id>`) via short-id map.
- Generator role consumers (example `answer.generator.strong`) when tools
  resolve/inject skills.
