# MCP Integration

This document covers MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a tool provider in the SDK.

For shared tool-subsystem behavior (agent-scoped config, alias resolution, isolated supervisor flow), see [Tool Subsystem](./tool-subsystem-README.md).

## What you configure

You configure MCP in the consumer surface:
1. `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent_id>.tools` in app props (what is visible/exposed to that agent).
2. `surfaces.as_consumer.mcp.services` in app props (how to connect and authenticate).

Top-level `mcp.services` and `MCP_SERVICES` env JSON are still supported as
legacy / local-dev fallbacks, but they are not the preferred platform contract.

### 1) Agent tool connection

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: knowledge
            kind: mcp
            server_id: knowledge
            alias: knowledge
            allowed: ["*"]
            tool_traits:
              "*":
                strategy: [exploration]

          - id: docs
            kind: mcp
            server_id: docs
            alias: docs
            allowed:
              - search
              - fetch
            tool_traits:
              search:
                strategy: [exploration]
              fetch:
                strategy: [exploration]
```

Rules:
- `server_id` must match an entry in `surfaces.as_consumer.mcp.services`
  (or a legacy fallback).
- `alias` is used in tool IDs: `mcp.<alias>.<tool_id>`.
- `allowed` omitted or `["*"]` exposes all server tools.
- A concrete list is an allow-list.
- `tool_traits` is consumer-side metadata. Use it to mark MCP tools with
  strategy traits for ReAct multi-action policy; `"*"` applies one trait block
  to all tools from that server connection.
- Multiple agents can connect to the same MCP server with different allow-lists.

The runtime resolves MCP entries from `surfaces.as_consumer` into MCP tool specs
with `agent_tool_config_from_bundle_props(...)`. `tools.agents` is a legacy
fallback for old bundles.

### 2) Consumer MCP service config

Supported service keys:
- `mcpServers` (preferred)
- `servers` (also supported)

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    mcp:
      services:
        mcpServers:
          stack:
            transport: stdio
            command: npx
            args: ["mcp-remote", "mcp.stackoverflow.com"]
          docs:
            transport: http
            url: https://mcp.example.com
            auth:
              type: bearer
              secret: b:docs.token
          local:
            transport: sse
            url: http://127.0.0.1:8787/sse
```

Legacy/dev fallback:

```bash
export MCP_SERVICES='{"mcpServers":{"docs":{"transport":"http","url":"https://mcp.example.com"}}}'
```

## Supported transports

| transport         | Required fields                | Notes |
|------------------|--------------------------------|------|
| `stdio`          | `command` (+ optional `args`)  | Local process or `npx mcp-remote ...` |
| `http`           | `url`                          | Streamable HTTP JSON-RPC |
| `streamable-http`| `url`                          | Alias of `http` |
| `sse`            | `url`                          | Server-sent events |

## Correct MCP server requirements

An MCP integration is considered correct when it is explicit about all runtime
boundaries: discovery, transport, auth, network reachability, lifecycle, tool
schemas, output size, and retry behavior.

Minimum checklist:

- the server is configured in app props
  `surfaces.as_consumer.mcp.services` or in a generated MCP client config owned
  by the caller
- the visible tools are allow-listed through
  `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent_id>.tools` or the client runtime's
  equivalent allow-list
- every tool name is stable and has a bounded input schema
- every tool returns bounded structured data; large files or artifacts should be
  returned as references, not huge inline payloads
- write tools are idempotent, run-scoped, or protected by caller-supplied ids so
  retries do not duplicate side effects
- auth is non-interactive in production and secrets are resolved through
  `get_secret(...)`, bundle secrets, or the runtime secret provider
- no secret values are written to bundle props, logs, tool responses, or
  generated workspace files unless the file is explicitly a short-lived local
  client config
- HTTP/SSE endpoints are reachable from the process that acts as MCP client
- stdio commands and their dependencies exist in the process that starts them
- streamable HTTP FastMCP apps are either created with `stateless_http=True` or
  are run behind a server/lifespan path that correctly initializes the MCP
  session manager
- logs include enough non-secret context to debug failures: server alias,
  transport, URL host, tool id, run id when applicable, and final status

For bundle-served MCP endpoints exposed with `@mcp(...)`, read:

- [Bundle Transports](../bundle/bundle-transports-README.md)
- [Bundle Agent Integration](../bundle/bundle-agent-integration-README.md)

For Claude Code consumers, remember that KDCube
`surfaces.as_consumer.mcp.services` does not configure Claude Code. The app
must write Claude-compatible MCP config into
the Claude workspace, usually `.mcp.json`, and the configured URL must be
reachable from the process/container that runs `claude`.
Use `ClaudeCodeWorkspaceConfig` / `prepare_claude_code_workspace(...)` from the
Claude Code SDK when you want the SDK to write the standard workspace files.

## MCP Tool Results And React File Hosting

When MCP tools are called through the React tool subsystem, their result is
handled by the same tool-result pipeline as bundle-local tools. A tool should
return the standard envelope when it is using the KDCube tool contract:

```json
{"ok": true, "error": null, "ret": {...}}
```

If an MCP-backed tool intentionally materializes files into the current React
`OUT_DIR`, it can opt into artifact hosting by putting a file declaration inside
`ret`:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "error": null,
  "ret": {
    "artifact_type": "files",
    "files": [
      {
        "type": "file",
        "path": "turn_123/files/export.csv",
        "filename": "export.csv",
        "mime_type": "text/csv",
        "visibility": "external"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

React v2 and v3 unwrap the envelope and host declared files only when
`ret.artifact_type == "files"`. The declared path must be accessible from
the React runtime, usually as an `OUT_DIR`-relative path under
`turn_<id>/files/...`. Remote MCP services that cannot write to that workspace
should return data or already-hosted references through an explicit product tool
contract instead of relying on automatic local hosting.

Bundle-local tools that call MCP internally may also host files themselves with
`bundle_tool_context.host_files(...)` after materializing the files. That helper
runs in the trusted bundle tool runtime, including isolated supervisor
execution. A pure remote MCP server does not receive the KDCube conversation
hosting service; it should either return the strict file declaration for files
that exist in the React workspace, or return product data that a bundle-local
tool can materialize and host.

For `host_files(...)` to work, the bundle-local tool must be running inside a
prepared KDCube tool context: active `ToolSubsystem`, hosting service,
communicator scope with tenant/project/user/conversation/turn, conversation
storage, and output directory. The normal React path prepares this in
`BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`; isolated execution prepares it through
`bootstrap_bind_all(...)`. If the tool context is not prepared, the helper raises
a runtime error instead of producing an unscoped hosted file.

### MCP results in the ReAct event-source pipeline

When `event_source_pipeline.enabled=true`, direct MCP tool calls still work with
the default structured-result behavior. The runtime tool id is:

```text
mcp.<alias>.<tool_name>
```

If no event-source declaration matches that id, ReAct applies the structured
fallback:
- JSON/text results become ordinary `conv:tc:<turn>.<call>.result` blocks.
- `ret.artifact_type == "files"` still produces declared file artifacts when
  the declared files exist in the React workspace.
- Generic JSON is not treated as a file-backed artifact.
- No source-pool rows, snapshots, or ANNOUNCE candidates are produced unless a
  policy explicitly adds them.

Remote MCP servers do not normally expose local Python `@event_source`
decorators to the KDCube tool subsystem. If an MCP-backed capability needs
custom ReAct behavior, use one of these patterns:

- wrap the MCP call in a bundle-local tool and decorate that local tool with
  `@event_source`;
- provide an explicit event-source module through `event_source_specs` when
  calling `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`, or through `event_specs` when
  creating a `ToolSubsystem` directly. The declaration's `event_source_id`
  must match the runtime MCP tool id, for example `mcp.docs.search`.

Use a custom policy only when the default structured result is not enough, such
as when rows should merge into `sources_pool`, a snapshot ref should be recorded,
or a later ANNOUNCE phase should materialize source-specific context.

## HTTP reachability and localhost

For HTTP, `url` means "reachable from the MCP client process", not "reachable
from the developer's browser".

Deployment rules:

- same local host: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` can work
- same container as the client process: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` can work if
  the server listens there
- different Docker container: `127.0.0.1` points at the client container, so use
  Docker service DNS or another internal host name
- ECS same task with shared task networking: localhost can work if the target
  container listens on the expected port
- ECS separate task/service: use Cloud Map, internal ALB, or another private
  service endpoint

If the server is bundle-served through `@mcp(...)`, the route path is:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/mcp/{alias}
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/{bundle_id}/public/mcp/{alias}
```

The caller still needs the correct scheme, host, and port for its deployment.

## Auth behavior

- `oauth_gui` / interactive auth servers are hidden (not listed in tool catalog).
- `bearer` / `api_key` / `header` auth supports either:
  - `auth.secret` → `get_secret("dot.path.key")`
  - `auth.env` → env lookup / `get_secret(env_key)` fallback
- Secrets are not written to Redis cache.
- MCP tool-list cache keys include the server connection shape and a hash of
  resolved auth headers. This allows principal-scoped MCP catalogs where
  `tools/list` legitimately differs by caller token.
- Set `ttl_seconds: 0` or `ttl: 0` on a server config to disable tool-list
  caching for that server.

## Secret resolution: named secrets and `${secret:...}` syntax

Two secret patterns are supported:

1. Auth block secret resolution:

```json
"auth": {
  "type": "bearer",
  "secret": "b:docs.token"
}
```

2. Stdio env interpolation:

For stdio servers, env values can use the `${secret:dot.path.key}` syntax to
resolve secrets via `get_secret()` at session creation time:

```json
"env": {
  "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "${secret:b:firecrawl.api_key}"
}
```

For bundle-local MCP configs, prefer:
- `b:...` for current bundle secrets
- no prefix / `a:...` for platform/global secrets

Fully qualified canonical keys such as `bundles.<bundle_id>.secrets...` are
still accepted when the explicit form is needed.

`get_secret()` resolution order:
1. Environment variables (via `_SECRET_ALIASES` in `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/config.py`)
2. Settings attributes (Pydantic BaseSettings)
3. Secrets manager provider (secrets-service / AWS SM / in-memory)

**Local dev:** secrets come from env vars in `.env.proc`. Each dot-path key
needs a corresponding alias in `_SECRET_ALIASES` (e.g.,
`"services.firecrawl.api_key": ["FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"]`).

**CLI deploy:** the CLI reads `secrets.yaml` / `bundles.secrets.yaml` and
injects values into the secrets-service sidecar or AWS Secrets Manager.

Consumer-surface `surfaces.as_consumer.mcp.services` is preferred because it is
app-scoped, sits next to the agent MCP tool declarations, and can use named app
secrets. `MCP_SERVICES` remains useful for process-wide local dev experiments
only.

## Runtime execution flow

1. `MCPToolsSubsystem.build_tool_entries()` contributes MCP entries to the tool catalog.
2. Planner selects an MCP tool ID: `mcp.<alias>.<tool_id>`.
3. `io_tools.tool_call(...)` parses `mcp` origin and routes to `MCPToolsSubsystem.execute_tool(...)`.
4. In isolated runtime, executor still calls `io_tools.tool_call(...)`; tool calls are delegated to supervisor, and MCP routing still happens there.
5. For isolated exec, the current MCP service config is exported from the live tool subsystem into runtime globals; it is not expected to be rebuilt from a fresh process env.

Dependency note:
- MCP server dependencies live with the MCP server itself, not with the bundle
  tool module that calls it
- that is different from bundle-local Python tools, where direct imports still
  depend on packages being present in the executing KDCube runtime unless the
  tool delegates into a bundle `@venv(...)` helper

## Tool ID format

- Format: `mcp.<alias>.<tool_id>`
- Alias must be a single segment (no dots).

## Local MCP server example: `web_search`

Server module:
- [`kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/tools/mcp/web_search/web_search_server.py`](../../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/tools/mcp/web_search/web_search_server.py)

Run server (stdio):

```bash
python -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.mcp.web_search.web_search_server --transport stdio
```

Run server (sse):

```bash
python -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.mcp.web_search.web_search_server --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8787
```

Run server (http):

```bash
python -m kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.mcp.web_search.web_search_server --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8787
```

Client config example:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    mcp:
      services:
        mcpServers:
          web_search:
            transport: stdio
            command: python
            args:
              - -m
              - kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.mcp.web_search.web_search_server
              - --transport
              - stdio
```

## Troubleshooting

- No MCP tools in catalog:
  - check `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools` has the server alias entry.
  - check `surfaces.as_consumer.mcp.services` has a matching `server_id` (or a legacy fallback).
  - validate transport fields (`command` for stdio, `url` for http/sse).
  - verify auth is not interactive (`oauth_gui`).
- MCP call fails at runtime:
  - confirm final tool ID is `mcp.<alias>.<tool_id>`.
  - confirm server exposes that `tool_id` and allow-list includes it.
  - confirm the MCP URL is reachable from the client process, not just from the
    host browser or another container.
  - for bundle-served FastMCP over streamable HTTP, confirm the app is
    `stateless_http=True` or has a valid lifespan/session-manager path.
  - confirm auth headers are present and that secrets resolve in the runtime
    that creates the MCP client.
