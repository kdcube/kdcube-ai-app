# Custom Tools (Bundle-Local)

This guide covers authoring and registration of bundle-local tools.

For runtime internals (descriptor resolution, supervisor flow, isolated execution), see [Tool Subsystem](./tool-subsystem-README.md).

## 1) Write a tool module

Tools are regular Python callables (usually async) with Semantic Kernel metadata:

```python
from typing import Annotated
import semantic_kernel as sk

try:
    from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function
except Exception:
    from semantic_kernel.utils.function_decorator import kernel_function

@kernel_function(name="search", description="Search bundle knowledge")
async def search(query: Annotated[str, "Search query"], n: Annotated[int, "Max results"] = 5):
    ...
```

## 2) Register tools in `tools_descriptor.py`

```python
TOOLS_SPECS = [
    {"module": "kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.web_tools", "alias": "web_tools", "use_sk": True},
    {"ref": "tools/local_tools.py", "alias": "doc", "use_sk": True},
]
```

Notes:
- `module` points to installed Python modules.
- `ref` is relative to bundle root (portable across host and isolated runtimes).
- `alias` becomes the tool ID prefix.

### Bundle-local imports from `ref` tools

Bundle-local tool modules may import same-bundle helpers with package-relative
imports:

```python
# tools/local_tools.py
from ..services.storage import MemoryStore
from ..resources.prompts import SEARCH_PROMPT
```

Do not use top-level bundle-local imports such as `from services...`,
`from tools...`, or `import resources`. Proc loads multiple bundles in one
Python process, so those top-level names are process-global and can collide
with another bundle.

Keep the bundle root and package directories importable by including
`__init__.py` files, for example:

```text
my-bundle@1-0/
  __init__.py
  tools/
    __init__.py
    local_tools.py
  services/
    __init__.py
    storage.py
```

The `ref` loader preserves this package context in normal in-process execution
and in isolated supervisor execution. Use `module` only for installed Python
modules outside the bundle.

## 3) Wire descriptor in workflow

Your workflow must pass descriptor values into subsystem creation:

```python
tool_subsystem, _ = create_tool_subsystem_with_mcp(
    service=self.model_service,
    comm=self.comm,
    logger=self.logger,
    bundle_spec=self.config.ai_bundle_spec,
    context_rag_client=self.ctx_client,
    registry={"kb_client": self.kb},
    raw_tool_specs=tools_descriptor.TOOLS_SPECS,
    tool_runtime=getattr(tools_descriptor, "TOOL_RUNTIME", None),
    mcp_tool_specs=getattr(tools_descriptor, "MCP_TOOL_SPECS", []),
    mcp_env_json=os.environ.get("MCP_SERVICES") or "",
)
```

## 4) Tool IDs and generated-code calls

Tool IDs are `<alias>.<function_name>`.

Generated code should execute tools through `agent_io_tools.tool_call(...)`:

```python
resp = await agent_io_tools.tool_call(
    fn=doc.search,
    params={"query": "KDCube architecture", "n": 5},
    call_reason="Find product architecture details",
    tool_id="doc.search",
)
```

## 4.1) Declaring Files For React Hosting

Custom tools must return the standard tool envelope:

```json
{"ok": true, "error": null, "ret": {...}}
```

If a custom tool intentionally produces files that should be delivered to the
user, mark the payload inside `ret` as a file result:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "error": null,
  "ret": {
    "artifact_type": "files",
    "files": [
      {
        "type": "file",
        "path": "turn_123/outputs/invoices/invoice.pdf",
        "physical_path": "turn_123/outputs/invoices/invoice.pdf",
        "filename": "invoice.pdf",
        "mime_type": "application/pdf",
        "size_bytes": 12345,
        "visibility": "external"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

React unwraps `{ok, error, ret}` first, then recognizes
`ret.artifact_type == "files"`. Each declared file is copied into the
conversation store and receives hosted artifact metadata such as `hosted_uri`,
`key`, `rn`, and `physical_path`.

This contract works for one file or many files. The marker and container are
strict: use `ret.artifact_type: "files"` and `ret.files[]`.

Use this only for deliberate file-producing tools. For example, a tool that
materializes a requested email attachment can declare that attachment for
hosting. A tool that merely returns message metadata should not do so.

Example bundle-local tool:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Annotated

try:
    from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function
except Exception:
    from semantic_kernel.utils.function_decorator import kernel_function

from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.bundle_tool_context import ok, scope


@kernel_function(name="export_report", description="Create a report file")
async def export_report(
    filename: Annotated[str, "Output filename"] = "report.txt",
):
    sc = scope()
    turn_id = sc["turn_id"]
    outdir = Path(sc["outdir"])
    rel = Path(turn_id) / "outputs" / "reports" / filename
    target = outdir / rel
    target.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    target.write_text("hello\n", encoding="utf-8")

    return ok({
        "artifact_type": "files",
        "files": [{
            "type": "file",
            "path": rel.as_posix(),
            "physical_path": rel.as_posix(),
            "filename": filename,
            "mime_type": "text/plain",
            "size_bytes": target.stat().st_size,
            "visibility": "external",
        }],
    })
```

Path rules:
- `path` / `physical_path` should be relative to the current React `OUT_DIR`.
- Use `turn_<id>/outputs/...` for tool-generated outputs.
- Use `visibility: "external"` only when the file is intended for user delivery.
- Do not inline large binary payloads in `ret`; write the file and return a path.

### Hosting From The Tool

Trusted bundle tools can host current-turn files themselves through
`bundle_tool_context.host_files`. The helper uses the active conversation scope
and returns the same declared-file payload shape, with hosted fields already
filled in:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.bundle_tool_context import host_files, ok


@kernel_function(name="export_report", description="Create and host a report")
async def export_report():
    # Write the file under the current OUT_DIR first.
    hosted = await host_files([
        {
            "path": "turn_123/outputs/reports/report.pdf",
            "filename": "report.pdf",
            "mime_type": "application/pdf",
            "visibility": "external",
        }
    ])
    return ok(hosted)
```

`host_files(...)` returns:

```json
{
  "artifact_type": "files",
  "files": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "hosted": true,
      "emitted": true,
      "hosted_uri": "...",
      "key": "...",
      "rn": "...",
      "filename": "report.pdf",
      "mime_type": "application/pdf"
    }
  ],
  "hosted_count": 1,
  "emitted": true
}
```

React records those rows as declared files and does not host them again.

Runtime availability:
- normal React tool calls run with the workflow `ToolSubsystem`, so
  `host_files(...)` can use the workflow hosting service directly.
- in-memory tool execution uses the same binding contract.
- isolated tool execution rebuilds the communicator, conversation store, and
  hosting-capable `ToolSubsystem` in the trusted supervisor/runtime bootstrap,
  so a catalog tool running there can also call `host_files(...)`.
- generated executor code reaches file hosting by calling a catalog tool through
  `agent_io_tools.tool_call(...)`; the catalog tool is the trusted boundary that
  writes files and calls `host_files(...)`.

Runtime context required:
- `host_files(...)` requires a bound `ToolSubsystem` with a hosting service.
- the bound communicator must carry enough conversation scope to place the
  artifact: tenant, project, user id, conversation id, turn id, and usually
  user type.
- the runtime must also provide conversation storage and an output directory
  where the declared file path is readable.
- the model should not pass those runtime ids as tool parameters; they must be
  prepared by the SDK runtime before the tool runs.

Normal ReAct workflows get this preparation when `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`
creates the `ToolSubsystem` with the workflow `ApplicationHostingService`.
Cached workflows refresh the request-bound communicator through
`BaseWorkflow.rebind_request_context(...)`.

Isolated execution gets the same preparation from
`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.bootstrap.bootstrap_bind_all(...)`. That
bootstrap restores runtime context, builds the communicator, recreates the
conversation hosting service, creates the tool subsystem, and binds the tool
modules. A custom isolated runner must call the SDK bootstrap or perform the
same preparation before a trusted tool can call `host_files(...)`.

If this preparation is missing, `host_files(...)` fails fast. Typical failures
are:
- `RuntimeError("tools are not bound to the current tool subsystem")`
- `RuntimeError("tool hosting service is unavailable")`
- `RuntimeError("tool communicator is unavailable")`
- `RuntimeError("bundle storage root is unavailable")`

Missing tenant, project, user id, conversation id, or turn id should be treated
as a runtime-preparation bug. Do not ask the LLM to invent those values.

Direct returned declarations and tool-side hosting are equivalent from React's
point of view. A tool may either return `ret.artifact_type: "files"` with local
paths, or call `host_files(...)` and return the already-hosted rows.

## 4.2) ReAct Event-Source Policies

ReAct can run an event-source policy pipeline for tool results. The pipeline is
controlled by `RuntimeCtx.event_source_pipeline_enabled` and can be enabled per
bundle:

```yaml
config:
  react:
    event_source_pipeline:
      enabled: true
```

A custom tool is a tool-backed event source when it runs inside ReAct. It is
still implemented and called as a normal tool; the event-source declaration only
adds policy metadata for validation, block production, timeline projection,
ANNOUNCE production, and compaction projection.

When the flag is enabled, custom tools continue to work even when they do not
declare event-source metadata. The default fallback is the structured-result
policy pack:

```text
react.block_production.tool_default
react.block_production.generic_result_item
react.block_production.declared_file_items
react.timeline_projection.identity
react.compaction_projection.identity
```

That fallback mirrors the old `external.py` behavior for ordinary custom tools:
- JSON/text results are rendered as ordinary `tc:<turn>.<call>.result`
  `react.tool.result` blocks.
- Errors become ordinary tool-result/error notices.
- `ret.artifact_type == "files"` still produces declared file artifacts.
- Generic JSON results are not treated as files just because the artifact id is
  the tool id.
- No source-pool rows, snapshots, or ANNOUNCE entries are produced unless the
  tool declares policies that produce those surfaces.

### Declaring a custom event source

If a tool needs custom ReAct behavior, decorate the tool-backed event source
with `@event_source`:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events import event_source
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.react.events import structured_result_source_policies

@event_source(
    event_source_id="{alias}.search",
    policies=structured_result_source_policies(),
    description="Search bundle records and return structured result rows.",
    kind="react.tool",
)
@kernel_function(name="search", description="Search bundle records")
async def search(query: Annotated[str, "Search query"], n: int = 5):
    ...
```

`{alias}` resolves to the alias from `TOOLS_SPECS`, so a module registered as
`{"ref": "tools/local_tools.py", "alias": "doc", "use_sk": True}` produces the
event source id `doc.search`.

The event source id is the semantic policy key. For tool-backed events:

```text
event_source_id == tool_id
event_id        == tool_call_id
```

### Declaring policy handlers

Policy handlers are normal Python functions registered with a ReAct phase:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.react.events import block_production_policy

@block_production_policy(event_policy_id="doc.block_production.search_results")
def search_results_policy(target, **context):
    rows = (target.get("ret") or {}).get("results") or []
    target.setdefault("source_rows", []).extend(rows)
    target["source_rows_merge"] = True
    return target
```

Then bind the policy from the event-source declaration:

```python
@event_source(
    event_source_id="{alias}.search",
    policies=[
        {"react_phase": "block_production", "event_policy_id": "react.block_production.tool_default"},
        {"react_phase": "block_production", "event_policy_id": "doc.block_production.search_results"},
        {"react_phase": "block_production", "event_policy_id": "react.block_production.generic_result_item"},
        {"react_phase": "timeline_projection", "event_policy_id": "react.timeline_projection.identity"},
        {"react_phase": "compaction_projection", "event_policy_id": "react.compaction_projection.identity"},
    ],
    kind="react.tool",
)
```

Use the built-in policy packs when they fit:
- `structured_result_source_policies()` for ordinary JSON/text result tools and
  declared file rows.
- `exploration_source_policies()` for search/fetch-like tools that should merge
  rows into `sources_pool`.
- `write_tool_source_policies()` for rendering/write tools where `params.path`
  is the produced artifact.
- `composite_artifact_source_policies()` for tools that return multiple
  surfaces such as hosted artifacts, snapshot refs, and announce candidates.

### Event modules without decorating the tool

Policies can also live in a separate event-source module. This is useful when
the callable tool is remote, generated, or owned by another package. Pass the
module through `event_source_specs` when calling `BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)`,
or through `event_specs` when creating a `ToolSubsystem` directly. The module
can return declarations from `list_event_sources()`.

```python
def list_event_sources():
    return [
        event_source_declaration(
            event_source_id="doc.search",
            policies=[...],
            kind="react.tool",
        )
    ]
```

The source id must still match the runtime tool id if the policy is meant to
handle that tool's result.

## 5) What a tool module receives at runtime

Tool modules are bound centrally by the runtime before use.

That happens in both:
- the normal in-process tool subsystem
- the isolated execution bootstrap path

Tool code should treat that runtime context as already prepared. Do not try to
construct it yourself.

### Optional bind hooks

If the module defines these hooks, the runtime calls them during binding:
- `bind_service(svc)`
- `bind_registry(registry)`
- `bind_integrations(integrations)`

These are optional convenience hooks. The runtime also stamps canonical globals
onto the module so tools can read the same names in both proc and isolated
execution.

### Canonical globals available in tool modules

| Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `_SERVICE` / `SERVICE` | The current `ModelServiceBase` for model/router access |
| `model_service` | Same service, under a more explicit name |
| `_INTEGRATIONS` / `INTEGRATIONS` | Small integration map prepared by the runtime |
| `_TOOL_SUBSYSTEM` / `TOOL_SUBSYSTEM` | Current `ToolSubsystem` instance when available |
| `_COMMUNICATOR` / `COMMUNICATOR` | Current `ChatCommunicator` when request context exists |
| `_KV_CACHE` / `KV_CACHE` | Shared KV cache handle when configured |
| `_CTX_CLIENT` / `CTX_CLIENT` | Current `ContextRAGClient` when present |
| `REGISTRY` | Registry objects explicitly provided by the workflow |

Current `INTEGRATIONS` content is intentionally small:
- `ctx_client`
- `kv_cache`
- `tool_subsystem`

Do not assume arbitrary host objects are present there unless your workflow
explicitly provides them.

### Communicator inside tools

Tools can emit progress or user-facing events through the normal chat
communicator.

The preferred read paths are:
- `_COMMUNICATOR` / `COMMUNICATOR` if your module wants a direct bound global
- `from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import get_comm`

Important current behavior:
- when a tool is used inside a chat turn, communicator usually has request and
  session context
- when the originating request carried an exact socket/stream target, direct
  peer delivery is possible
- when the originating path only carried `session_id`, emits fan out to the
  whole session room

For the request-path details, see [Bundle Runtime](../bundle/bundle-runtime-README.md).

### Shared browser and other importable runtime services

Some facilities are not stamped as globals, but are still safe to use from tool
modules as normal SDK services. For example:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.rendering.shared_browser import get_shared_browser

browser = await get_shared_browser()
```

This is the same shared browser service used by rendering tools such as
`rendering_tools` / `md2pdf_async`.

### Example pattern

```python
_SERVICE = None
_INTEGRATIONS = None

def bind_service(svc):
    global _SERVICE
    _SERVICE = svc

def bind_integrations(integrations):
    global _INTEGRATIONS
    _INTEGRATIONS = integrations or {}

async def my_tool(...):
    cache = (_INTEGRATIONS or {}).get("kv_cache")
    comm = (_INTEGRATIONS or {}).get("tool_subsystem").comm if (_INTEGRATIONS or {}).get("tool_subsystem") else None
    ...
```

If you prefer not to read from `_INTEGRATIONS`, reading `_KV_CACHE`,
`_COMMUNICATOR`, or `get_comm()` is also valid.

## 6) Optional per-tool runtime overrides

```python
TOOL_RUNTIME = {
    "doc.search": "local",
    "web_tools.web_search": "local",
    "rendering_tools.write_pdf": "docker",
    "exec_tools.python_exec": "fargate",
}
```

If a tool is not listed, default runtime policy applies.

## 6.1 Custom dependencies for bundle-local tools

Bundle-local tools do not currently get their own `requirements.txt` install
step from the tool subsystem.

Current behavior:
- a custom tool module is imported into the current execution runtime
- for in-process execution, that means the proc interpreter
- for isolated execution, that means the isolated runtime / supervisor
- therefore any third-party package imported directly by the tool module must
  already be installed in that runtime

What is supported today:
- if the tool needs a package-heavy leaf operation, keep the tool function
  lightweight and call a bundle-local helper marked with `@venv(...)`
- that helper can then use a bundle-managed cached subprocess venv derived from
  the runtime plus the bundle's `requirements.txt`

What is **not** supported today:
- automatic per-tool dependency installation from `tools_descriptor.py`
- automatic bundle-tool `requirements.txt` resolution separate from
  `@venv(...)`

Practical recommendation:
- direct imports in the tool module only for dependencies already present in
  the runtime image
- use `@venv(...)` only for dependency-heavy leaf work
- keep request-bound objects such as communicator, DB pools, and Redis clients
  outside that helper boundary

## 7) Optional MCP tool sources

```python
MCP_TOOL_SPECS = [
    {"server_id": "web_search", "alias": "web_search", "tools": ["web_search"]},
    {"server_id": "docs", "alias": "docs", "tools": ["*"]},
]
```

For MCP transport/auth/runtime details, see [MCP Integration](./mcp-README.md).
