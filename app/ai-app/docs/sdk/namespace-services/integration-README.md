# Namespace Services: Integration Flow

This is the current reference shape for connecting one bundle that owns a
namespace to another bundle that wants to display, search, open, or otherwise
act on that namespace.

## Notation

Diagrams use `Party.field` when a value is owned or emitted by a specific
party. For example:

- `Canvas.card.object_ref` is the ref stored on the canvas/card event.
- `ReAct.target.logical_path` is the logical path carried into ReAct block
  production.
- `Discovery.entry` is a provider record from Named Service Discovery.
- `TaskProvider.ret.extra.event_source_id` is returned by the provider's
  resolver function.

If a step uses data, the diagram names the owner of that data. No host layer
derives task object kinds, task rendering rules, colors, icons, open actions,
or download actions from URI shape. Scene/widget/canvas clients pass the full
`object_ref`; the resolver router finds the owner resolver, and the provider
function owns URI interpretation. See
[Object Refs, Presentation, And Actions](object-ref-presentation-and-actions-README.md).

## System Picture

```text

  TaskProvider.refs = task:issue:*                           agents.main.event_sources.kind = named_service

        v
  bundle_registry transport calls TaskProvider.named_services() in-process
  or bundle_operation transport calls TaskProvider.@api(alias="named_service")
```

## Startup And Discovery

```text
TaskProvider bundle load
  TaskProvider.spec:
    spec.namespace = task
    spec.provider_id = task.issue
    spec.refs = task:issue:*, task:issue:attachment:*/attachments/*, task:issue:*
    spec.object_kinds = task.issue, task.attachment
    spec.search_scopes = provider-declared searchable scoped namespaces
    spec.operations includes event.resolve, object.get, block.produce, ...

        |
        v

TaskProvider.entrypoint.on_bundle_load
  reads TaskProvider.named_services().providers()
  writes Discovery.entry into Redis:
    Discovery.entry.scope = Request.tenant/project
    Discovery.entry.bundle_id = task-tracker@1-0
    Discovery.entry.provider_id = task.issue
    Discovery.entry.operations = TaskProvider.spec.operations
    Discovery.entry.refs = TaskProvider.spec.refs
    Discovery.entry.object_kinds = TaskProvider.spec.object_kinds
    Discovery.entry.search_scopes = TaskProvider.spec.search_scopes

        |
        v

Consumer bundle startup
  reads Versatile.props.surfaces.as_consumer
  registers local adapters:
    CanvasResolver(namespace=task) from ui.canvas.resolvers
    ArtifactRehoster(namespace=task) from agent event_sources pull policy
    EventSource(named_services.task) from agent event_sources block policy
    EventSourceResolver(namespace=task) from agent event_sources discovery

These adapters do not own task semantics. They only know:
  Consumer.config.namespace = task
  Consumer.config.allowed surfaces/operations
  Discovery can find the provider when a request happens
```

## Search Scope Discovery And Tool Catalog Flow

Search scopes are provider-declared object spaces. They are carried by provider
registration/discovery so a consumer can render them in the model tool catalog
without first calling the provider. `provider.about` remains available for
richer domain guidance, but it is not required for the fast "which namespace
argument should I use for search?" path.

```text
1. Provider app startup
   executor: provider bundle entrypoint / named_service_provider spec
   surface: provider registration surface
   customized: yes, provider owns object-space names
   emits:
     Provider.spec.namespace = sensor
     Provider.spec.search_scopes:
       - sensor:temperature     label="temperature readings"
       - sensor:humidity:aggr   label="humidity aggregates"

        |
        v

2. Named Service Discovery
   executor: RedisNamedServiceDiscovery.register(...)
   surface: tenant/project discovery table
   customized: no, generic SDK persistence
   stores:
     Discovery.entry.spec.search_scopes = Provider.spec.search_scopes

        |
        v

3. Consumer ReAct tool catalog refresh
   executor: ToolSubsystem.react_tools(...)
   surface: consumer app ReAct decision setup
   customized: no namespace semantics
   work:
     read configured base namespaces from surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools
     read provider Discovery.entry rows once for those namespaces
     bind named_service_discovery_entries into the generic named_services tool module

        |
        v

4. Generic named-service tool catalog
   executor: named_services_providers.tools.list_tools()
   surface: model-callable tool metadata
   customized: consumer allow-list only
   work:
     if object.search is allowed for base namespace sensor:
       expose named_services.search_objects
       attach search_scopes_by_namespace.sensor from discovery/config

        |
        v

5. ReAct prompt renderer
   executor: build_tools_block(...)
   surface: rendered tool catalog visible to the model
   customized: no provider code
   renders:
     Scope:
       - namespaces applicable: sensor
       - provider search scopes:
           sensor:
             - sensor:temperature - temperature readings
             - sensor:humidity:aggr - humidity aggregates

        |
        v

6. Model tool call
   executor: LLM generation governed by ReAct harness

       query="lab reading spike",
       limit=10
     )

        |
        v

7. Provider object.search
   executor: provider NamedServiceProvider.object_search(...)
   surface: provider app backend
   customized: yes, provider owns search/index semantics
   receives:
     NamedServiceRequest.namespace = sensor:temperature
   returns:
     bounded object descriptors with canonical refs, labels, summaries,
     object_kind, mime, and provider cursor when applicable

        |
        v

8. Search result side channel
   executor: named_services.search_objects wrapper
   surface: ReAct tool result + subsystem artifact
   customized: no provider semantics
   emits:
     named_service.search_results
     payload.items[] = context-compatible handles

        |
        +--> Capable UI client
             surface: optional named-service search results widget
             work:
               render rows
               click -> normal object.action resolver path
               drag  -> normal context attach/pin path
```

> The "normal context attach/pin path" means each result row is dragged as a
> [context pin](../npm/components-core/context-pin-contract-README.md): one envelope
> with the native uri in `ref`, so it opens/pins natively rather than as a generic object.

The base namespace in `namespaces applicable` remains the policy boundary. The
provider search scopes beneath it are valid `namespace` arguments for
`named_services.search_objects`; each one means "search this provider-declared
object space."

## Object Action Flow

Example: the user presses **Download** on a canvas card whose ref is a task
attachment. Each step names the code executor, the surface inside that
executor, and whether that step is generic or app-specific.

In this section:

- **consumer app** means the app that mounted the canvas/chat/scene surface and
  configured `surfaces.as_consumer`; in the current reference this is
  `versatile@2026-03-31-13-36`;
- **consumer app operation** means an ordinary bundle/app object-action facade.
  The current compatible API alias is
  `@api(alias="canvas_object_action", route="operations")`;
- **provider app** means the app that owns the namespace and registered
  `named_services()` for it; in the current reference this is
  `task-tracker@1-0`.

```text
1. Browser
   executor: CanvasBoard React component mounted in the consumer app UI
   surface: canvas/pinboard UI surface
   customized: no, generic canvas component
   input:
     Canvas.card.object_ref =
       task:issue:attachment:issue_1/attachments/ta_1/v000001/evidence.md
     action = download

        |
        v

2. Browser embedding adapter
   executor: the consumer app/widget/scene that embedded CanvasBoard
   surface: browser-to-app operation adapter

   call:
     POST ConsumerApp object-action facade
       current compatible alias: @api(alias="canvas_object_action", route="operations")
     payload.object_ref = Canvas.card.object_ref
     payload.action = download

   Current reference:
     ConsumerApp = versatile@2026-03-31-13-36
     operation = VersatileEntrypoint.canvas_object_action(...)

        |
        v

3. Consumer app backend
   executor: consumer bundle entrypoint method decorated with @api
   surface: operations API surface of the consumer app
   customized: yes, consumer chooses which resolvers are registered
   work:
     Request.auth = current user/session/tenant/project
     build CanvasObjectResolverRegistry
     register configured resolvers from Consumer.config.surfaces.as_consumer.ui.canvas
     call registry.object_action(payload)

        |
        v

4. Generic SDK registry
   executor: CanvasObjectResolverRegistry
   surface: canvas object resolver dispatch
   customized: no, generic SDK
   work:
     namespace = split_namespace(Canvas.card.object_ref) = task
     resolver = registered resolver for namespace task

        |
        v

5. Generic named-service resolver bridge
   executor: NamedServiceCanvasObjectResolver
   surface: configured canvas/chat resolver adapter
   customized: configured, not hardcoded
   builds:
     NamedServiceRequest.operation = object.action
     NamedServiceRequest.namespace = task
     NamedServiceRequest.object_ref = Canvas.card.object_ref
     NamedServiceRequest.action = download
     NamedServiceRequest.context.source = canvas.object_action
     NamedServiceRequest.context.tenant/project = Consumer request scope

        |
        v

6. Generic provider discovery/transport
   executor: named-service endpoint/discovery transport
   surface: service discovery + bundle_registry or bundle_operation transport
   customized: provider endpoint config/discovery entry
   work:
     Discovery.resolve(object.action, task, object_ref)
       -> Discovery.entry(provider_id=task.issue, bundle_id=task-tracker@1-0)
     bundle_registry transport:
       calls TaskTrackerEntrypoint.named_services().provider("task.issue")
     bundle_operation transport:
       calls TaskTrackerEntrypoint.@api(alias="named_service")

        |
        v

7. Provider app backend
   executor: TaskIssueNamedServiceProvider.object_action(...)
   surface: provider registry surface inside task-tracker app
   customized: yes, provider owns task semantics
   work:
     parse object_ref
     classify object_kind = task.attachment
     enforce auth/capability
     run provider action = download
     build provider-owned download URL with bundle_operation_url(...)
   returns:
     ret.extra.download_url =
       /api/integrations/bundles/.../operations/issue_attachment_download?object_ref=...
     ret.extra.filename = evidence.md
     ret.extra.mime = text/markdown

        |
        v

8. Browser
   executor: CanvasBoard React component
   surface: generic canvas download behavior
   customized: no
   work:
     create temporary <a href=download_url download=filename>
     browser GETs download_url with its current cookies/session

        |
        v

9. Provider app backend binary operation
   executor: TaskTrackerEntrypoint.issue_attachment_download(...)
   surface: provider app @api(alias="issue_attachment_download", route="operations")
   customized: yes, provider owns bytes/storage
   work:
     authenticate request again
     parse object_ref or issue_id/attachment_id
     read provider storage
     return BundleBinaryResponse(bytes, filename, mime)

        |
        v

10. Browser
    executor: browser download stack
    surface: native file download
    customized: no
    result:
      user receives evidence.md
```

The task attachment ref remains provider-owned the entire time. Canvas owns the
card and click UI. The consumer app owns the `@api` entrypoint that its canvas
calls. The task provider owns task/attachment semantics and byte access.

## Same Ref Across Surfaces

The same provider-owned ref can travel through every consumer surface. The
consumer changes; the provider contract does not.

```text
Provider object
  TaskProvider.object_ref =
    task:issue:attachment:issue_1/attachments/ta_1/v000001/evidence.md

        |
        +--> chat context chip
        |     Consumer calls object.resolve for label/actions.
        |     On click, Consumer runs default_open_effect_action from provider.
        |
        +--> canvas/pinboard card
        |     Consumer stores Canvas.card.object_ref unchanged.
        |     On open/download, Consumer calls object.action.
        |
        +--> scene host
        |     Consumer receives Provider.ret.ui_event.target_surface.
        |     Scene routes that target to the mounted widget/component.
        |
        +--> ReAct context/materialization
              Consumer calls event.resolve + block.produce for model context.
              react.pull calls object.get(response_mode=stream) for bytes.
```

For an attachment ref, the task provider can return:

```text
object.resolve:
  object_kind = task.attachment
  actions = [preview, open, download]
  default_open_effect_action = download
  parent.object_ref = task:issue:issue_1

object.action(action=download):
  download_url = /api/integrations/bundles/.../issue_attachment_download?object_ref=...
  filename = evidence.md
  mime = text/markdown

object.get(response_mode=stream):
  chunks = attachment bytes for react.pull or another materializer
```

No consumer surface should hardcode that `task:` attachments download while
`task:` issues open an editor. The task provider declares that per concrete
object handle.

## ReAct External Event Block Flow

When a task card is dropped into chat, the event occurrence may be authored by
canvas or a widget. That occurrence source is not rewritten to `named_services`.

```text
Ingress/event lane
  Event.payload.event.event_source_id = Canvas.event_source_id
    example: task.context or task_tracker.issue
  Event.payload.event.logical_path = task:issue:issue_123
  Event.payload.event.hosted_uri = task:issue:issue_123
  Event.payload.event.title = Canvas.card.title

        |
        v

ReAct timeline browser
  ReAct.target.event_source_id = Event.payload.event.event_source_id
  ReAct.target.logical_path = Event.payload.event.logical_path
  ReAct.target.hosted_uri = Event.payload.event.hosted_uri

Step 1: authored source gets first chance
  EventSourceSubsystem.by_event_source_id(ReAct.target.event_source_id)
  If that source has block_production policy:
    apply it

Step 2: if no blocks were produced, route by owner URI
  EventSourceSubsystem.resolve_event_source_for_ref(ReAct.target.logical_path)
    namespace = split_namespace(ReAct.target.logical_path) = task
    resolver = registered resolver function for namespace task

        |
        v

Named-service resolver bridge
  Builds NamedServiceRequest:
    request.operation = event.resolve
    request.namespace = task
    request.object_ref = ReAct.target.logical_path
    request.context.source = event_source_resolver
  Discovery.resolve(event.resolve, task, request.object_ref)
    -> Discovery.entry(provider_id=task.issue)
  Calls TaskProvider.event_resolve(ctx=Request.auth, request)

        |
        v

Provider resolver function
  TaskProvider.resolve_task_event_source(request.object_ref)
  Returns:
    TaskProvider.ret.extra.event_source_id = named_services.task
    TaskProvider.ret.extra.object_ref = request.object_ref
    TaskProvider.ret.extra.object_kind = task.issue OR task.attachment
    TaskProvider.ret.extra.namespace = task

        |
        v

ReAct block production through resolved source
  EventSourceSubsystem applies source named_services.task
  Named-service block policy builds:
    request.operation = block.produce
    request.namespace = task
    request.object_ref = TaskProvider.ret.extra.object_ref
  Discovery selects TaskProvider again for block.produce
  TaskProvider.block_produce returns:
    TaskProvider.ret.extra.blocks[] = model-visible blocks
```

The host only performs namespace dispatch. It does not infer `task.issue`,
`task.attachment`, markdown shape, or editor target from the URI. Those values
come from `TaskProvider.event_resolve` and `TaskProvider.block_produce`.

## Pull Flow

Materializing a task-owned object or attachment into the ReAct workspace:

```text
Agent/tool
  ReAct calls react.pull(paths=[
    "task:issue:issue_123",
    "task:issue:attachment:issue_123/attachments/ta_1/v000001/evidence.md"
  ])

        |
        v

Consumer artifact rehoster
  EventSourceSubsystem.namespace_rehoster(task)
  Rehoster builds NamedServiceRequest per path:
    request.operation = object.get
    request.namespace = task
    request.object_ref = ReAct.pull.path
    request.response_mode = stream
    request.context.source = react.pull
    request.context.auth = Request.auth

        |
        v

Discovery and provider
  Discovery.resolve(object.get, task, request.object_ref)
    -> Discovery.entry(provider_id=task.issue)
  TaskProvider.object_get(ctx=Request.auth, request)

        |
        v

Provider stream result
  For task issue JSON:
    TaskProvider.response.ret.object = task issue descriptor
    TaskProvider.chunks = UTF-8 JSON bytes
    TaskProvider.media_type = application/vnd.kdcube.task.issue+json

  For task attachment:
    TaskProvider.response.ret.object = task attachment descriptor
    TaskProvider.chunks = attachment bytes
    TaskProvider.media_type = attachment MIME

        |
        v

ReAct workspace materialization
  Runtime writes TaskProvider.chunks to:
    ReAct.fi.logical_path = fi:turn_<id>....
    ReAct.physical_path = current turn workspace file
  react.pull returns:
    PullResult.materialized[].logical_path = ReAct.fi.logical_path
    PullResult.materialized[].object_ref = provider-returned canonical URI
    PullResult.materialized[].response = TaskProvider.response
    PullResult.errors[] = TaskProvider.error response, if any

  react.read(ReAct.fi.logical_path) emits:
    block.path = ReAct.fi.logical_path
    block.meta.object_ref = provider-returned canonical URI
    block.meta.source_namespace = provider root namespace
```

Owner projection then runs before the generic read block is committed:

```text
1. ReAct read tool
   executor: react.tools.read.handle_react_read
   surface: consumer app ReAct runtime
   customized: no provider semantics
   reads:
     block.meta.object_ref = task:... / mem:... / other provider ref

        |
        v

2. Owner event-source resolution
   executor: EventSourceSubsystem
   surface: consumer app event-source registry
   customized: provider may implement event.resolve
   work:
     try provider event.resolve(object_ref)
     else use registered named_services.<root_namespace> event source
   traces:
     react.read.owner_projection status=namespace_event_source/no_event_source/...

        |
        v

3. Named-service block policy
   executor: named_services.block_production.provider
   surface: generic named-service event-source adapter
   customized: no provider semantics
   work:
     call provider block.produce(object_ref=object_ref, target=read target)

        |
        v

4. Provider block production
   executor: provider NamedServiceProvider.block_produce(...)
   surface: provider app backend
   customized: yes, provider owns model-visible text shape
   returns:
     ret.extra.blocks[] with owner-authored ReAct blocks

        |
        v

5. ReAct visible context
   executor: react.read
   surface: current turn timeline
   work:
     append provider blocks when returned
     otherwise append generic textual fi: read block

        |
        v

6. Optional provider render projection
   executor: Timeline.render() named-service render adapter
   surface: consumer ReAct prompt rendering
   customized: no provider semantics in the adapter
   work:
     scan visible blocks for object_ref values
     group candidate blocks by named_services.<namespace> event source
     call provider block.render concurrently for relevant providers
     pass a bounded block snapshot plus render_context
     merge valid patches for provider-owned block indexes

        |
        v

7. Provider block rendering
   executor: provider NamedServiceProvider.block_render(...)
   surface: provider app backend
   customized: yes, provider owns final model-facing rendering
   receives:
     blocks[] with stable index values
     render_context.phase = timeline_projection
     render_context.audience = model
     render_context.event_source_id = named_services.<namespace>
   returns:
     patch operations such as patch_block, replace_block, append_block_after
```

The provider enforces access before streaming. If access is denied, missing, or
misconfigured, `react.pull` returns an `errors` row containing the provider's
named-service error code and response.

Normal block rendering does not copy provider bytes. ReAct gets bytes from
foreign namespaces only through explicit pull materialization. Provider
`block.render` receives already-produced visible blocks and returns rendering
patches; it is not a file/body materialization path.

The `fi:` path is only the local workspace location. Namespace-aware rendering
and policy selection uses the preserved `object_ref` / `source_namespace`
metadata, not the `fi:` prefix. The detailed runtime-boundary diagram for this
path is [ReAct Object Materialization](react-object-materialization-README.md).

## ReAct Named-Service Tool Flow

Example: the model calls `named_services.search_objects`,
`named_services.host_file`, or `named_services.upsert_object`. Each step names
where code executes, which surface executes it, and which part is customized.

```text
1. LLM generation
   executor: model stream governed by ReAct runtime
   surface: ReAct action/tool lane
   customized: no provider code; prompt and tool catalog influence output
   emits:
     action = call_tool
     tool_id = named_services.search_objects
     params.namespace = <configured namespace or provider-declared scoped namespace>

        |
        v

2. ReAct runtime and harness
   executor: ReAct v3 runtime in the consumer app process
   surface: decision/tool-execution phase
   customized: no namespace semantics
   work:
     validate the action packet
     apply multi-action strategy/harness rules
     choose ToolSubsystem for accepted tool calls

        |
        v

3. Consumer app tool config
   executor: agent_tool_config_from_bundle_props(...)
   surface: Consumer.config.surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools
   customized: yes, per consumer app and agent
   owns:
     namespace allow-list = <configured base namespace>
     visible operations = provider.about, object.search, object.host_file,
                          object.upsert, object.delete, ...
   maps provider operations to generic tool names:
     object.search    -> named_services.search_objects
     object.get       -> named_services.get_object
     object.host_file -> named_services.host_file
     object.upsert    -> named_services.upsert_object
     object.delete    -> named_services.delete_object

        |
        v

4. Generic named-service tool adapter
   executor: kdcube_ai_app...named_services_providers.tools
   surface: ToolSubsystem module call
   customized: configured namespace/provider endpoints, not provider object semantics
   builds:
     NamedServiceRequest.operation = object.search OR object.host_file OR ...
     NamedServiceRequest.namespace = original tool namespace argument
     NamedServiceRequest.context.base_namespace = configured base namespace
     NamedServiceRequest.object_ref = tool params object_ref, when present
     NamedServiceRequest.context.source = named_services.client_tool
     NamedServiceRequest.context.auth = current ReAct request/session

        |
        v

5. Generic provider discovery/transport
   executor: NamedServiceEndpoint / call_named_service_endpoint(...)
   surface: service discovery + bundle_registry/bundle_operation transport
   customized: provider endpoint config/discovery entry
   work:
     Discovery.resolve(operation, base_namespace, object_ref)
       -> Discovery.entry(provider_id=<provider id>, bundle_id=<provider app>)
     bundle_registry:
       call ProviderEntrypoint.named_services() in-process
     bundle_operation:
       call ProviderEntrypoint.@api(alias="named_service", route="operations")

        |
        v

6. Provider app backend
   executor: provider NamedServiceProvider.<operation>(ctx, request)
   surface: provider registry/API surface inside provider app
   customized: yes, provider owns namespace and object semantics
   examples:
     object.search:
       query provider storage/index and return bounded object descriptors
     object.host_file:
       read caller file descriptor under auth, store provider attachment,
       return Provider.object_ref for the new provider-owned file object
     object.upsert:
       validate provider schema and mutate the object
     object.get(response_mode=stream):
       stream provider-owned object bytes for react.pull

        |
        v

7. ReAct tool result
   executor: ToolSubsystem result handling in the consumer app
   surface: ReAct tool result artifact/timeline
   customized: no provider semantics
   result:
     success -> bounded NamedServiceResponse JSON or pull materialization rows
     failure -> provider error code/message preserved in the tool result
   side effect for object.search:
     emit subsystem artifact sub_type = named_service.search_results
     payload.items[] = generic context handles:
       ref/object_ref, label, summary, namespace, object_kind, mime

        |
        +--> Capable browser client
             executor: chat/scene/widget reducer and renderer
             surface: optional search-result UI
             customized: no namespace semantics
             work:
               render result rows as context objects
               click -> normal object.action resolver path
               drag  -> normal context attach/pin path

        |
        v

8. Next ReAct decision
   executor: model sees accepted tool result in the next round
   surface: ReAct timeline/context
   customized: model behavior only; provider result remains authoritative
```

Important ownership rules:

- The model sees generic tool names. The provider supplies schemas through
  `provider.about` and `object.schema`.
- The consumer app decides which named-service tools and namespaces the agent
  may call.
- The named-service tool adapter does not know how provider objects or scoped
  searches work. It only builds `NamedServiceRequest`.
- The provider app owns object parsing, permissions, search, mutation,
  hosting, streamed bytes, and any domain-specific error.
- Large bytes do not ride inside generic tool JSON. `react.pull` uses
  `object.get(response_mode=stream)` and writes provider bytes into ReAct
  `fi:` workspace files.

## Host-File Flow

Hosting a ReAct/runtime file into a provider namespace is the reverse direction
from pull. Pull reads `Provider.object_ref` into `ReAct.fi`. Host-file gives
the provider a caller-owned file descriptor and receives `Provider.object_ref`
for the hosted file.

```text
ReAct/runtime
  ReAct.file_ref = fi:turn_1.files/report.md
  ReAct.filename = report.md
  ReAct.mime = text/markdown

        |
        v

Agent tool call
  named_services.host_file(
    namespace = task,
    object_ref = task:issue:issue_123,
    file_ref = ReAct.file_ref,
    filename = ReAct.filename,
    mime = ReAct.mime
  )

        |
        v

Named-service tool wrapper
  Builds NamedServiceRequest:
    request.operation = object.host_file
    request.namespace = task
    request.object_ref = task:issue:issue_123
    request.payload.file.ref = ReAct.file_ref
    request.payload.file.filename = ReAct.filename
    request.payload.file.mime = ReAct.mime
    request.context.auth = Request.auth

        |
        v

Discovery and provider
  Discovery.resolve(object.host_file, task, request.object_ref)
    -> Discovery.entry(provider_id=task.issue)
  TaskProvider.object_host_file(ctx=Request.auth, request)

        |
        v

Provider storage and response
  TaskProvider reads or resolves ReAct.file_ref under Request.auth
  TaskProvider writes bytes into TaskProvider.attachment_store
  TaskProvider returns:
    TaskProvider.ret.attrs.object_ref =
      task:issue:attachment:issue_123/attachments/ta_1/v000001/report.md
    TaskProvider.ret.extra.object_kind = task:attachment
    TaskProvider.ret.extra.attach_with = provider-specific upsert hint
```

Hosting does not mutate the parent object by itself. If the agent wants the
file cited on the issue, it must make the provider-declared object mutation:

```text
Agent tool call
  named_services.upsert_object(
    namespace = task,
    object_ref = task:issue:issue_123,
    object_json = {
      attachment_refs: [{
        ref: TaskProvider.ret.attrs.object_ref,
        filename: report.md,
        mime: text/markdown
      }]
    }
  )

        |
        v

TaskProvider.object_upsert
  verifies Request.auth can edit/attach
  cites Provider.attachment_ref on Provider.issue
```

The bytes do not travel in JSON. The initial implementation uses artifact refs
or trusted runtime-local file descriptors; future transports can replace that
descriptor handoff with request-body streaming without changing the provider
operation name or the two-step host/cite strategy.

## Provider Host Checklist

1. Define a provider class using `@named_service_provider(...)`.
2. Register that provider in a `NamedServiceRegistry`.
3. Expose `named_services()` so same-KDCube clients can call the registry
   directly.
4. Register the provider registry into Named Service Discovery during
   `on_bundle_load` after required local storage/indexes are ready.
5. Expose one bounded API operation, normally `@api(alias="named_service")`,
   when `bundle_operation` or external clients need an API facade.
6. Dispatch the operation with `dispatch_named_service_api_request(...)`; the
   same helper handles `response_mode: stream`.
7. Return canonical object descriptors under `ret.object`, list/search results
   under `ret.items`, common response metadata under `ret.attrs`, UI commands
   under `ret.ui_event`, and bounded provider-specific action metadata under
   `ret.extra`. Consumer surfaces must not inspect `ret.object` internals to
   invent labels, object kinds, capabilities, open actions, or download actions.
8. Implement `object.schema` for each object kind that agents may mutate.
9. Implement `event.resolve` as the lightweight provider function for
   `uri -> resolution info` such as `event_source_id`, `object_ref`, and
   `object_kind`. It must not read the object body.
10. Implement streamed `object.get` for attachment refs that should become
   ReAct `fi:` artifacts.
11. Implement `object.host_file` when callers need to create provider-owned
   file refs from runtime files or artifact refs.
12. Implement `block.produce` when provider objects should become
    model-visible ReAct read blocks. Implement `block.render` when provider
    objects need custom prompt-render patches or explicit rendered
    representations.
13. Keep owner storage and mutation rules inside the provider bundle.

## Client Bundle Checklist

1. Configure `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools` for model-visible
   named-service tools and namespace allow-lists.
2. Configure `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.event_sources` for
   provider-backed block production and `react.pull` materialization.
3. Configure `surfaces.as_consumer.ui.canvas.resolvers` when canvas/chat object
   actions should resolve refs in the namespace.
4. Declare `kind: named_service` under
   `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools`.
5. Register artifact rehosters with
   `register_configured_named_service_artifact_rehosters(...)`.
6. Register namespace event sources with
   `register_configured_named_service_event_sources(...)` when lane events can
   carry `event_source_id: named_services.<namespace>`.
7. Route object open results through the scene surface registry.

## Resolution Scope

The current resolution path is generic for configured namespaces:

```text
object_ref -> namespace -> Named Service Discovery -> provider endpoint -> provider operation
```

Named Service Discovery is a Redis-backed tenant/project provider table. It is
not a one-namespace/one-bundle map: multiple bundles may register providers for
the same namespace when they expose different operations, refs, or object
kinds. The runtime selects a provider per request.

For model clients, `provider.about` explains the service and base objects.
`object.schema` explains concrete object payloads. Provider ids may use an
internal dotted id such as `task.issue`; presentation/object-kind keys should
match the provider's advertised `object_kind` values, commonly
`task:issue` or `task:attachment`. Generic CRUD tools stay generic; the
provider supplies the entity shape.

For canvas/chat resolution, the client only enables the namespace resolver.
The provider remains the authority for concrete resolver actions and returns a
normal named-service response or rejection for each request.

## Canvas Proxy Resolve And Action Flow

Canvas stores a proxy card with `Canvas.card.object_ref`. The card does not own
the external object actions. The namespace provider owns the URI grammar,
object-kind split, capabilities, auth checks, and action result.

```text
User opens card drawer
  -> Canvas.card.object_ref = task:issue:attachment:<issue_id>/attachments/<attachment_id>/v<version>/<filename>
  -> Canvas server calls Provider.object.resolve(object_ref=Canvas.card.object_ref)
  -> Provider resolves Provider.ref:
       Provider.ref.object_kind = task.attachment
       Provider.ref.parent = task:issue:<issue_id>
       Provider.ref.capabilities = {preview, open, download, ...}
  -> Canvas stores the resolver result on the card UI state only

User clicks card action
  -> Canvas server calls Provider.object.action(action=<clicked>, object_ref=Canvas.card.object_ref)
  -> Provider parses Provider.ref again
  -> Provider enforces Provider.auth policy
  -> Provider returns one bounded result:
       preview: Provider.object metadata/short text
       open: Provider.ui_event target surface command
       download: Provider.bytes encoded for browser download or an explicit provider download handle
       error: Provider.error with status/message
```

`object.resolve` is the lightweight `uri -> resolution info` contract for
canvas/chat affordance discovery. It must not read a large object body or stream
bytes. `object.action` is used after the user chooses a concrete action such as
`preview`, `open`, or `download`.

For example, a task issue and a task attachment share the `task` namespace but
resolve differently:

```text
task:issue:<issue_id>
  Provider.object_kind = task.issue
  Provider.actions = preview, open
  Provider.download = false

task:issue:attachment:<issue_id>/attachments/<attachment_id>/v<version>/<filename>
  Provider.object_kind = task.attachment
  Provider.parent = task:issue:<issue_id>
  Provider.actions = preview, open, download
  Provider.download = true when Provider.auth allows read
```

No canvas code should special-case `task`, `memo`, `file`, or any other
namespace-owned object kind. Canvas chooses visible buttons from the resolver
capabilities returned by the owner provider.
