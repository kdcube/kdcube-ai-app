# Namespace Services: Clients

A client is any runtime surface that consumes a namespace service: a ReAct
agent, Codex, Claude Code, an MCP client, a widget, a scene host, a bundle API,
a Data Bus handler, or a scheduled job.

When the client is an agent, it is still a service consumer. Namespace-service
access is therefore configured under the consumer bundle's
`surfaces.as_consumer` surface, alongside the other tools and UI resolver
surfaces that the bundle consumes.

## Bundle Configuration

Client bundles configure namespace access under one bundle prop root:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    default_agent: main
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: task_service
            kind: named_service
            alias: named_services
            namespaces:
              task:
                allowed:
                  - provider.about
                  - object.list
                  - object.search
                  - object.schema
                  - object.host_file
                  - object.upsert
                  - object.delete
        event_sources:
          - kind: named_service
            namespace: task
            enabled: true
            discovery:
              mode: service_discovery
            policies:
              block_production:
                mode: provider
                operation: block.produce
              pull:
                mode: provider
                operation: object.get
    ui:
      canvas:
        resolvers:
          - kind: named_service
            namespace: task
            enabled: true
            discovery:
              mode: service_discovery
            allowed: [object.resolve, object.action]
```

The namespace key declares that this bundle may consume refs in that namespace.
Provider location is normally resolved from Named Service Discovery. A provider
bundle registers its available providers into the tenant/project Redis table
when it is loaded.

The discovery scope itself is portable runtime context. The platform carries a
JSON-safe tenant/project discovery descriptor through `comm_ctx`, and the
target runtime reconstructs `RedisNamedServiceDiscovery` from runtime
configuration. Do not pass Redis clients through tool registries. See
[Cross-Runtime Context](../../runtime/cross-runtime-context-README.md).

An explicit `providers` list is optional and should be used only when a client
must pin concrete endpoints instead of using discovery. The list is plural
because one namespace may be served by multiple providers. For bundles in the
same KDCube runtime, the resolved or explicit transport should normally be
`bundle_registry`. That path calls the owner bundle's `named_services()`
registry object under the current request/session context. Use
`bundle_operation` when the owner should be reached through its
`@api(alias="named_service")` facade. Use `module` when the provider registry
is in an importable Python module in the same runtime.

Explicit providers are still provider endpoint overrides, not the normal
consumer surface. Keep them outside the agent-visible tool contract and use
them only when service discovery is not available for that deployment. The
normal same-runtime path is:

```text
Consumer.surfaces.as_consumer
  -> namespace task
  -> discovery.mode service_discovery
  -> Redis Named Service Discovery for tenant/project
  -> Provider registry entry
  -> provider operation
```

Inside an agent tool item, `namespaces.<namespace>.allowed` controls which
model-callable named-service tools are visible to that agent. If a UI resolver
surface is allowed to call `object.action`, the provider remains authoritative
for the concrete action name it accepts or rejects.

The configured namespace is the base namespace used for policy and endpoint
resolution. A provider may advertise narrower scoped namespaces for specific
operations, especially search. In that case, the client still authorizes the
base namespace, while the request preserves the full scoped namespace so the
provider can choose the right object space.

The namespace `pull` policy is separate from model-callable tools. A client may
allow `react.pull` to materialize provider refs through provider `object.get`
without exposing the generic `named_services.get_object` tool to the agent.

## Consumer Contract For All Surfaces

A consumer surface configures access and routes effects. It does not own the
foreign namespace semantics.

```text
Consumer config
  agents.<agent>.tools:
    allow model-callable provider operations

  agents.<agent>.event_sources:
    allow event.resolve, block.produce, object.get pull/materialization

  ui.canvas.resolvers:
    allow object.resolve and object.action for canvas/chat/pinboard refs

  scene surface registry:
    map provider-returned target_surface values to mounted UI surfaces
```

Every consumer surface should follow the same sequence:

```text
Incoming object handle
  object_ref = task:issue:attachment:BUG-123/attachments/ta_1/v000001/evidence.md
        |
        v
Consumer finds namespace = task
        |
        v
Consumer calls provider operation allowed for that surface:
  object.resolve       -> cheap metadata, actions, default_open_effect_action
  object.action(open)  -> provider ui_event, scene routes target_surface
  object.action(download) -> provider download_url, browser streams bytes
  object.get(stream)   -> ReAct/materializer writes bytes to fi:
  block.produce        -> model-visible blocks
        |
        v
Consumer renders/routes the returned result without rewriting task semantics
```

The consumer owns:

| Consumer-owned value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `surfaces.as_consumer` config | Which namespace, operation families, tools, and UI resolvers are enabled. |
| current `AuthContext` | Tenant, project, session, user, job, or service principal carried by the runtime. |
| surface registry | Which local iframe/widget/component handles a returned `target_surface`. |
| card/chip layout | How an already-resolved object handle appears in canvas, chat, or pinboard. |

The provider owns:

| Provider-owned value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `object_kind`, `actions`, `capabilities` | Semantics for the concrete ref. |
| `default_open_effect_action` | What a generic click/open should run for this concrete object. |
| `download_url` and file metadata | How the browser downloads provider-owned bytes. |
| streamed `object.get` representation | How ReAct or other materializers pull the object into a workspace. |
| `block.produce` output | How the object becomes model-visible context. |

## Consumer Execution Surfaces

A **consumer app** is the app that mounted a surface and configured
`surfaces.as_consumer`. It may be a chat app, a scene page, a bundle widget,
or a backend workflow. "Consumer operation" is not a separate concept: it is
the app's normal `@api(..., route="operations")` entrypoint that its browser
surface or backend flow calls.

For example, when a canvas card is clicked:

```text
Browser surface
  executor: CanvasBoard React component
  surface: canvas/pinboard UI
  owns: click, selected action, Canvas.card.object_ref
  customized: no, generic component

        |
        v

Consumer browser adapter
  executor: page/widget/scene code that mounted CanvasBoard
  surface: browser-to-app operation adapter
  owns: which app operation URL to call
  customized: yes, per consumer app

        |
        v

Consumer app backend operation
  executor: consumer app @api(alias="canvas_object_action", route="operations")
  surface: operations API of the consumer app
  owns: AuthContext, resolver registry construction, allowed resolver config
  customized: yes, consumer chooses configured resolvers

        |
        v

Generic SDK resolver registry
  executor: CanvasObjectResolverRegistry
  surface: SDK resolver dispatch
  owns: namespace dispatch and resolver lookup
  customized: no

        |
        v

Named-service resolver/client
  executor: NamedServiceCanvasObjectResolver and NamedServiceClient transport
  surface: configured named-service adapter
  owns: NamedServiceRequest shape, discovery/transport call
  customized: configured by namespace/provider discovery, not domain-coded

        |
        v

Provider app backend
  executor: provider app named_services() registry or @api(alias="named_service")
  surface: provider registry/API surface
  owns: object kind, actions, auth checks, bytes, ui_event, download_url
  customized: yes, provider owns namespace semantics
```

For ReAct, the same separation applies:

```text
ReAct tool lane
  executor: ReAct runtime + ToolSubsystem in the consumer app
  surface: model-callable tool execution
  owns: tool-call validation, tool result artifacts, round routing
  customized: no namespace semantics

        |
        v

Consumer config
  executor: agent_tool_config_from_bundle_props(...)
  surface: surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools
  owns: which named_service tools and namespaces the agent may call
  customized: yes, per consumer app/agent

        |
        v

Named-service tool adapter
  executor: named_services.search_objects / host_file / upsert_object / ...
  surface: generic tool module
  owns: mapping tool name to provider operation
  customized: allowed namespaces and provider endpoint config

        |
        v

Provider app backend
  executor: provider operation such as object.search, object.host_file,
            object.upsert, object.get, block.produce
  surface: provider registry/API surface
  owns: schema, mutation, search, file hosting, streamed bytes
  customized: yes, provider-owned domain behavior
```

## Client Ids

Use the concrete runtime identity when you need a narrow policy:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    agents:
      solver.react.v2.decision.v2.strong:
        tools:
          - id: task_service
            kind: named_service
            alias: named_services
            namespaces:
              task:
                allowed: [provider.about, object.search, object.schema, object.upsert]
```

Use `default_client` when every configured model/client surface in the bundle
may use the namespace service tools:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    default_agent: main
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: task_service
            kind: named_service
            alias: named_services
            namespaces:
              task:
                allowed: [provider.about, object.search]
```

## Runtime Use

Model-callable tools are added by declaring a named-service tool connection:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: task_service
            kind: named_service
            alias: named_services
            namespaces:
              task:
                allowed:
                  - provider.about
                  - object.search
                  - object.schema
                  - object.upsert
```

`agent_tool_config_from_bundle_props(...)` turns this config into the generic
`named_services.*` tool module and per-tool namespace allow-lists.

The current ReAct integration passes the ReAct agent id as the namespace
service client id. Other runtimes can pass their own client id when their tool
adapters are wired.

Agents should use `provider.about.search_scopes[]` to choose the searchable ref
scope and default search semantics. Use `object.schema` for exact body fields
and filters. For ReAct specifically, fully reading a provider-owned namespace ref means
`react.pull(<provider_ref>)` first, then `react.read(<materialized fi:...>)`.
This applies even when the provider object is JSON or markdown, not only when
it is a binary file. The provider decides the materialized representation and
MIME. `named_services.get_object` is the provider operation behind configured
pull, not the default ReAct-facing way to read provider object content. The
generic `object.upsert` and `object.delete` tools intentionally do not encode
domain-specific fields; the provider owns those schemas.

When an agent has a file in its own runtime and needs that file represented in
the provider's namespace, it should call `named_services.host_file` if the tool
catalog lists the target namespace as applicable. The provider returns its own
file object/ref. If the target object schema supports attachments or file
links, the agent then cites that returned provider ref in a separate
`named_services.upsert_object` call. Hosting the file and mutating the domain
object are different operations.

## Resolver Use

Canvas and chat object actions use a configured resolver registry:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.named_services_providers import (
    named_service_canvas_resolver_namespaces,
)

register_configured_named_service_canvas_resolvers(
    registry,
    namespaces=named_service_canvas_resolver_namespaces(self.bundle_props),
    tenant=tenant,
    project=project,
    logger=_log,
)
```

This lets a scene or chat widget open `task:issue:issue_123` without knowing
task-tracker API aliases. The resolver calls the owning bundle's
named-service endpoint through the configured transport. Same-KDCube
integrations normally use `bundle_registry`; large object bytes are streamed
only by explicit pull materialization, not during normal render. Here "normal
render" means canvas/chat/timeline preview, open, and block projection. Those
paths may resolve metadata or model-visible blocks, but they do not copy
provider-owned bytes into ReAct's `fi:` workspace.
The client bundle does not configure provider-specific resolver semantics here:
`surfaces.as_consumer.ui.canvas.resolvers` only opts the namespace and canvas
operation families into use. `object.resolve` resolves a concrete ref into
metadata, parent refs, capabilities, and cheap display information.
When present, `default_open_effect_action` tells a generic UI what to run when
the user opens/clicks that specific object handle. The consumer must treat this
as provider-owned object semantics; do not infer it from namespace, host
surface, or broad capabilities.
For `open`, the host scene still owns the UI reaction. It uses the returned
`ui_event.target_surface` to focus/mount the concrete app surface and send that
surface's command. This keeps provider object semantics separate from host UI
orchestration.
`object.action` runs explicit UI actions such as `open`, `preview`, or
`download`. The owning provider decides which actions are accepted for the
concrete object ref.
For `download`, consumers should prefer provider-returned `download_url` and
let the browser issue an authenticated GET with normal platform cookies.
`content_base64` can be handled as a compatibility fallback, but new provider
integrations should not depend on it.

### Consumer-Owned Versus Provider-Owned Values

The client bundle owns connection policy and runtime context, not namespace
semantics.

```text
Consumer-owned:
  Consumer.config.surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools
  Consumer.config.surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.event_sources
  Consumer.config.surfaces.as_consumer.ui.canvas.resolvers
  Consumer.request.auth_context
  Consumer.event.logical_path or Consumer.card.object_ref

Provider-owned:
  Provider.object_kind for a URI
  Provider.event_source_id for provider rendering
  Provider.block markdown/shape
  Provider.object schema and mutation payloads
  Provider.permission decisions
```

When ReAct receives a foreign ref on a lane event, the consumer event-source
subsystem first tries the event's authored source. If that source does not
produce blocks, it calls the namespace resolver function for the ref namespace.
For configured named-service namespaces, that resolver function calls provider
`event.resolve` with `request.object_ref = Consumer.event.logical_path`. The
provider returns `ret.extra.event_source_id` and any other resolution metadata.
The consumer then applies the resolved event source and delegates block
production to provider `block.produce`.

ReAct uses the same namespace config for backend artifact materialization:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.named_services_providers import (
    named_service_agent_pull_namespaces,
)

register_configured_named_service_artifact_rehosters(
    event_sources,
    namespaces=named_service_agent_pull_namespaces(self.bundle_props, client_id=agent_id),
    tenant=tenant,
    project=project,
)
```

This lets `react.pull` materialize refs such as `task:issue:issue_123` or
`task:issue:attachment:issue_123/attachments/ta_1/v000001/evidence.md`. The rehoster
calls the owning provider's configured pull operation, normally `object.get`,
with `response_mode: stream`. The provider returns structured named-service
metadata plus async byte chunks; the runtime writes the chunks into the ReAct
`fi:` workspace. Access checks happen in the provider under the current auth
context, and provider errors are returned in the `react.pull` tool result under
`errors`.

Configured namespaces can also publish ReAct block-production policies:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.named_services_providers import (
    named_service_agent_event_source_namespaces,
)

register_configured_named_service_event_sources(
    event_sources,
    namespaces=named_service_agent_event_source_namespaces(self.bundle_props, client_id=agent_id),
)
```

The helper registers event sources such as `named_services.task`. When a lane
event already uses that event source and carries a `task:` ref, the policy
calls the provider's `block.produce` operation and appends the returned blocks.
When a lane event uses another authored source but carries a configured
foreign ref, the resolver bridge calls provider `event.resolve` first and uses
the provider-returned event source id before block production.
