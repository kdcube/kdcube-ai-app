# Turn Log Structure (Current)

The turn log is the single source of truth for reconstructing a turn.
It stores **only the ordered timeline blocks** emitted during that turn.
All user/assistant text, attachments, tool results, and artifacts are encoded in those blocks.
That includes Internal Memory Beacons written with `react.write(channel="internal")`.
It can also include live-folded external user event blocks (`user.followup`, `user.steer`)
when those events reached the active timeline owner during the turn.

## Top‑level shape
```json
{
  "turn_id": "turn_1777000000000_abcd12",
  "ts": "2026-02-07T10:12:33Z",
  "blocks": [ ... ]
}
```

## Blocks (contrib log)
`blocks` is the ordered list of event blocks for this turn. Each block has:
- `type`
- `author`
- `turn_id`
- `ts`
- `mime`
- `path`
- `text` (text content) or `base64` (binary)
- `meta` (optional; includes artifact metadata, hosted file fields, etc.)

See `event-blocks-README.md` for block types and examples.

Important React-specific beacon blocks:
- `react.note` for freshly written Internal Memory Beacons
- `react.note.preserved` for beacon copies kept visible after compaction

Important external-event blocks:
- `user.followup`
- `user.steer`
- `assistant.completion` may appear more than once in the same turn when multiple visible
  assistant completions happened before the turn finally closed

These are persisted as ordinary turn blocks once folded into the active timeline. Their metadata
retains the durable event identity (`message_id`, `stream_id`, `sequence`) and routing hints such as
`target_turn_id` / `owner_turn_id`.

Runtime meaning:
- a persisted `user.followup` means the active turn actually consumed that live followup
- a persisted `user.steer` means the active turn saw the steer, engineering interrupted the live phase, and React finalized the turn from that same timeline

## Reconstruction
The turn view is reconstructed by:
```
Timeline.build_turn_view(turn_id, blocks, sources_pool)
```
which yields:
- latest user prompt (text + ts)
- latest assistant completion (text + ts)
- full assistant completion list (`assistants[]`) when more than one completion block exists
- user attachments (payloads with rn/hosted_uri/filename/mime)
- assistant files (payloads with rn/hosted_uri/filename/mime)
- citations (sources_used resolved against sources_pool)
- follow‑up suggestions (from `stage.suggested_followups` blocks)

Rendered model view (via `timeline.render`) groups tool output into:
- `[TOOL CALL <id>].call <tool_id>`
- `[TOOL RESULT <id>].summary <tool_id>` (artifact tools)
- `[TOOL RESULT <id>].result <tool_id>` (non‑artifact tools)
- `[TOOL RESULT <id>].artifact <tool_id>` per artifact (logical_path + content)

## Notes
- No `user` / `assistant` fields are stored in the turn log.
- Fetch reconstructs `chat:user` / `chat:assistant` from the ordered block stream, so one turn may
  materialize into multiple user and assistant chat entries.
- The latest assistant completion keeps the legacy logical path alias
  `ar:<turn_id>.assistant.completion`; earlier visible completions use
  `ar:<turn_id>.assistant.completion.<n>`.
- No `files` list is stored separately. Files are reconstructed from blocks.
- All paths must include concrete `turn_id` (no `current_turn`).
- Internal Memory Beacons are stored in the turn log as normal blocks, but they are not user-facing UI artifacts.
- The turn log itself does not store the conversation-level external replay cursor; that cursor lives in
  the timeline artifact payload (`last_external_event_id`, `last_external_event_seq`).
