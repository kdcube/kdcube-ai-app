# ReAct Announce Block (ANNOUNCE banner)

This doc describes how the **announce** block is used for ReAct v2.

## What it is
- An **ephemeral tail block** added by the runtime for each decision round.
- Contains ANNOUNCE️:
  - iteration
  - open-plan summary with plan ids, snapshot refs, and status markers (if any exist)
  - compact live-turn external event summary (`followup`, `steer`) when present
  - compact workspace status
  - authoritative temporal context (UTC + user timezone)
  - optional system notices (e.g., cache TTL pruning)

## Where it appears
- It is appended at the end of the timeline when `timeline(include_announce=True)` is called.
- It is **never cached**.

## Lifecycle
- During the loop: updated each round with a fresh ANNOUNCE.
- On exit: the final announce block is **persisted** into the turn log blocks,
  then announce is cleared.

## Feedback in ANNOUNCE
- Feedback updates are fetched **only at turn start** (timeline load).
- If cache is **hot**, feedback remains in ANNOUNCE each round until a cold turn incorporates it.
- If cache is **cold**, feedback is injected into the target turn(s) and ANNOUNCE shows the same updates
  once with “(incorporated into turn timeline)”.
- After incorporation, those items are **not** repeated in later turns.

## System messages in announce
When cache TTL pruning occurs, the render path appends a one-time announce block
containing a system notice. It appears after the budget section and advises
the agent to use `react.read(path)` to restore truncated context.

## Workspace state in ANNOUNCE
ANNOUNCE may include a compact `[WORKSPACE]` section.

Its purpose is operational guidance, not full git/debug observability.

It can include:
- `implementation: custom|git`
- `current_turn_root`
- `materialized_turn_roots`
- `current_turn_scopes`
- in `git` mode only:
  - `repo_mode`
  - `repo_status`
- publish state:
  - `current_turn_publish`
  - `last_published_turn`
  - `publish_error` only when the current turn publish failed

Important rule:
- ANNOUNCE should stay compact
- raw git refs, commit shas, and other low-level publish metadata do not belong here unless there is a failure that React must react to immediately

## Live turn events in ANNOUNCE
When the current turn has already consumed busy-turn external events, ANNOUNCE includes a compact
`[LIVE TURN EVENTS]` section.

Its purpose is operational orientation, not full replay. It surfaces current-turn:
- `followup`
- `steer`

Important semantics:
- `followup` means the current turn already accepted additional same-turn user input
- `steer` means engineering already recorded a stop/reorient control event on the current turn timeline
- a live steer can interrupt an in-flight generation or cancellable tool phase before React re-enters a short bounded finalize phase

ANNOUNCE only shows current-turn live events. Historical preserved event blocks remain on the timeline itself.

## Why it exists
- Keeps high‑frequency state updates out of the cached timeline.
- Allows downstream agents (final answer generator) to see the **last ℹ️ ANNOUNCE ℹ️**
  via the persisted contribution block.

## Notes
- ANNOUNCE is the open/current plan presentation layer; React does not rely on a separate persistent `react.plan.active` tail artifact.
- Closed, complete, and superseded plans are excluded from ANNOUNCE.
- An open plan is not automatically current. Only explicitly current plans carry the `(current)` tag.
- If a plan is shown without `(current)`, React must activate it before acknowledging any of its steps.
- Announce is not cached and is re‑rendered each decision round.
- The `[WORKSPACE]` section is intentionally brief; detailed publish metadata belongs in internal event blocks, not the visible announce surface.
- The `[LIVE TURN EVENTS]` section is also intentionally brief; it is a same-turn control summary, not a replacement for the underlying timeline blocks.
- The example uses simplified plan ids (`plan_alpha`, `plan_beta`) for readability. Real runtime-generated `plan_id` values may look like `plan:turn_3:efgh5678`, and the matching stable alias would then be `ar:plan.latest:plan:turn_3:efgh5678`.
