# ReAct Announce Block (ANNOUNCE banner)

This doc describes how the **announce** block is used for ReAct v2 and v3.

## What it is
- An **ephemeral tail block** added by the runtime for each decision round.
- Contains ANNOUNCE️:
  - iteration
  - explicit iteration-budget explanation when live reactive credits increased the turn ceiling
  - open-plan summary with plan ids, snapshot refs, and status markers (if any exist)
  - compact live-turn external event summary (`followup`, `steer`) when present
  - compact workspace status
  - current isolated runtime limits and active workspace usage
  - authoritative temporal context (UTC + user timezone)
  - optional system notices (e.g., cache TTL pruning)

## Where it appears
- It is appended at the end of the timeline when `timeline(include_announce=True)` is called.
- It is **never cached**.

## Lifecycle
- During the loop: updated each round with a fresh ANNOUNCE.
- On exit: the final announce block is **persisted** into the turn log blocks,
  then announce is cleared.

## Runtime limits in ANNOUNCE
ANNOUNCE includes a compact `[RUNTIME LIMITS]` section when runtime context is
available.

The section is recomputed for every decision round. It shows:
- `exec file max`: maximum size of one file created by a single exec call
- `exec workspace delta max`: maximum net-new writable bytes a single exec call may add
- `active workspace max`: maximum total active workspace bytes, if configured
- `active workspace used`: bytes currently present in the local active workspace
- `remaining`: remaining active workspace capacity before the next exec call
- `next exec new bytes max`: effective new-byte budget for the next exec call, computed as the smaller of `exec workspace delta max` and active-workspace `remaining`
- `effective single new file max`: effective size for one newly created file, computed from the file cap and the next-exec byte budget

The active workspace count includes files currently present in the local turn
workspace, including current-turn project files, produced artifacts, materialized attachments, and
exec work files. Hosted-only attachments and already-offloaded historical data do
not count until they are materialized or pulled into the active workspace.

This section is the authoritative round-local signal for output sizing. Older
cached context or static bundle instructions may describe the policy, but ANNOUNCE
contains the current remaining capacity.

## Inactive tools in ANNOUNCE
ANNOUNCE includes an `[INACTIVE TOOLS THIS TURN]` section when tools are
genuinely absent from the current turn's tool set. It renders right after
`[RUNTIME LIMITS]` and only when `RuntimeCtx.inactive_tools` carries entries.

Connected-account consent is demand-driven and keeps claim-gated tools IN the
set: which tools a turn needs only becomes clear as the agent works, so a
tool invocation with unmet claims returns the structured consent envelope to
the agent (`consent_required`, the provider, THAT tool's claims, the
Connection Hub deep link, and a short instruction to narrate the ask and keep
working with the other tools) while the platform raises the scoped consent
banner in chat.

## Connected accounts update in ANNOUNCE
When a consent demand raised by an earlier attempt in this conversation is
satisfied (the user connected or approved the account), the next turn renders
`[CONNECTED ACCOUNTS UPDATE]` from `RuntimeCtx.reactivated_tools` — the
current truth stated louder than the model's own earlier prose:

```text
[CONNECTED ACCOUNTS UPDATE]
  - Slack account is connected; tools (post_slack_message, search_slack) are active this turn.
  This is the current state — it supersedes earlier notes in this conversation that named these tools unavailable. Use them directly for the user's request.
```

Both sections live in ANNOUNCE because the facts are turn-local (they change
the moment the user connects an account or flips a toggle); keeping them out
of the instruction text preserves the cached prompt slice. The
construction-side story is owned by
[How To Construct A ReAct Agent](./how/how-to-construct-react-agent-README.md).

## Feedback in ANNOUNCE
- Feedback updates are fetched **only at turn start** (timeline load).
- If cache is **hot**, feedback remains in ANNOUNCE each round until a cold turn incorporates it.
- If cache is **cold**, feedback is injected into the target turn(s) and ANNOUNCE shows the same updates
  once with “(incorporated into turn timeline)”.
- After incorporation, those items are **not** repeated in later turns.

## System messages in announce
When cache TTL pruning occurs, the render path appends a one-time announce block
containing a system notice. It appears after the budget section and advises
the agent to use `react.read(path)` to restore truncated context.

## Workspace state in ANNOUNCE
ANNOUNCE may include a compact `[WORKSPACE]` section.

Its purpose is operational guidance, not full git/debug observability.

It can include:
- `implementation: custom|git`
- `current_turn_root`
- `local turn roots`
- `current editable workspace`
- in `git` mode only:
  - `repo_mode`
  - `repo_status`
  - `previous saved workspace paths (pull to bring local; checkout to edit)`
- publish state:
  - `current_turn_publish`
  - `last_published_turn`
  - `publish_error` only when the current turn publish failed

Important rule:
- ANNOUNCE should stay compact
- raw git refs, commit shas, and other low-level publish metadata do not belong here unless there is a failure that React must react to immediately

## Live turn events in ANNOUNCE
When the current turn has already consumed busy-turn external events, ANNOUNCE includes a compact
`[LIVE TURN EVENTS]` section.

Its purpose is operational orientation, not full replay. It surfaces current-turn:
- `followup`
- `steer`

Important semantics:
- `followup` means the current turn already accepted additional same-turn user input
- `steer` means engineering already recorded a stop/reorient control event on the current turn timeline
- a live steer can interrupt an in-flight generation or cancellable tool phase before React re-enters a short bounded finalize phase

ANNOUNCE only shows current-turn live events. Historical preserved event blocks remain on the timeline itself.

## Why it exists
- Keeps high‑frequency state updates out of the cached timeline.
- Allows downstream agents (final answer generator) to see the **last ℹ️ ANNOUNCE ℹ️**
  via the persisted contribution block.

## Example (open plans)

    - files/src/ (5 files)
  repo_mode: sparse git repo
  repo_status: dirty

```

When a live reactive event increased the turn budget, ANNOUNCE must explain that explicitly instead of silently changing the denominator:

```text
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ANNOUNCE — Iteration 4/16 (15 + 1 reactive bonus)          ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

[BUDGET]
  iterations  ██░░░░░░░░  12 remaining  (base 15 + 1 bonus from live reactive events)
  time_elapsed_in_turn   2m41s
```

This avoids the misleading shape where the user only sees the ceiling jump from `15` to `16` with no cause given.

## Notes
- ANNOUNCE is the open/current plan presentation layer; React does not rely on a separate persistent `react.plan.active` tail artifact.
- Closed, complete, and superseded plans are excluded from ANNOUNCE.
- An open plan is not automatically current. Only explicitly current plans carry the `(current)` tag.
- If a plan is shown without `(current)`, React must activate it before acknowledging any of its steps.
- Announce is not cached and is re‑rendered each decision round.
- The `[WORKSPACE]` section is intentionally brief; detailed publish metadata belongs in internal event blocks, not the visible announce surface.
- The `[LIVE TURN EVENTS]` section is also intentionally brief; it is a same-turn control summary, not a replacement for the underlying timeline blocks.
- The example uses simplified plan ids (`plan_alpha`, `plan_beta`) for readability. Real runtime-generated `plan_id` values may look like `plan:turn_3:efgh5678`, and the matching stable alias would then be `conv:ar:plan.latest:plan:turn_3:efgh5678`.
