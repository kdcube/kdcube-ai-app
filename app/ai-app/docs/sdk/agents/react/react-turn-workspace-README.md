# ReAct Turn Workspace

This document defines the **actual workspace structure** used by ReAct and how it evolves across phases:
- local turn start (`exec-workspace/ctx_v2_*`)
- tool execution and artifact population
- optional turn snapshot persistence
- distributed/Fargate serialization, restore, and merge-back

The workspace is execution state. Canonical conversation state still lives in timeline/sources/turn-log artifacts.

## Effective agent workspace model

The agent does **not** perceive one flat filesystem. It reasons across several surfaces:

```text
VISIBLE / ADDRESSABLE WORKSPACE MODEL

1) CURRENT TURN OUT_DIR (physical; current-turn execution surface)
   out/
     turn_<current_turn>/
       files/           # only normal writable namespace for react tools
       attachments/     # current-turn attachments and rehosted copies pulled into this turn
     logs/              # runtime logs and diagnostics
     timeline.json
     ...
   work/                # exec scratch only; not stable collaboration state

2) CONVERSATION ARTIFACT MEMORY (logical; cross-turn; not a browsable folder)
   ar:...  tc:...  so:...  su:...
   fi:<older_turn>.files/...
   fi:<older_turn>.user.attachments/...

3) BUNDLE KNOWLEDGE SPACE `ks:` (logical; read-only virtual folder)
   ks:<bundle-defined-path>/...
   ...

4) FUTURE COLLABORATIVE WORKSPACES (planned; not active in current React agent)
   out/workspaces/<name>/...
```

Current behavior:
- History is preserved physically under `out/turn_<id>/files/...` and `out/turn_<id>/attachments/...`.
- Writes for the current turn go only to `out/<current_turn>/files/...`.
- Reads can target:
  - versioned turn artifacts and attachments
  - any readable file already present under `out/` (for example `out/logs/docker.err.log`)
  - exact logical `ks:` paths via `react.read`
- The practical mental model is:
  - `turn_<id>/files/...` and `turn_<id>/attachments/...` preserve origin and history
  - the latest visible version of a file path is the current logical workspace view
  - runtime folders like `logs/` are part of OUT_DIR but are not part of the turn-versioned file namespace
  - `ks:` is not inside OUT_DIR at all; it is a bundle-owned read-only virtual space

### Knowledge space and exec-time path resolution

`ks:` is readable by logical path, for example `react.read(["ks:<bundle-defined-path>"])`.

Important constraints:
- `react.search_files` does not browse `ks:`.
- `fetch_ctx` does not support `ks:`.
- `ks:` becomes a physical directory tree only inside isolated exec **if** the bundle exposes a namespace resolver/helper for it.

When such a resolver exists, the generated code flow is:
1. start from a logical ref such as `ks:<bundle-defined-root>`
2. call the bundle/helper resolver inside exec
3. receive an exec-local physical path
4. browse descendants in code
5. emit discovered logical refs like `ks:<bundle-defined-root>/foo/bar.py` back into OUT_DIR artifacts or logs so the agent can later call `react.read` on them

If the bundle does **not** expose a resolver for directory-style browsing, then `ks:` remains readable only by exact logical path or by bundle-specific search tools. It is not a normal browseable filesystem from standard React tools.

### Future collaborative workspaces

The current React agent does **not** yet have a shared mutable workspace that overwrites files across turns.

The planned future model is a named collaborative workspace under something like `out/workspaces/<name>/...`, potentially git-backed. Until tooling explicitly exposes that surface, treat it as future design only.

## Lifecycle at a glance

1. ReAct creates a fresh per-turn workspace directory (`ctx_v2_*`) with `work/` and `out/`.
2. During the turn, tools and runtime write files into `out/` (and sometimes `work/`).
3. Optionally, `react.persist_workspace()` stores zipped `out`/`work` for diagnostics.
4. For distributed/Fargate exec, a lightweight snapshot is built, uploaded, restored remotely, then outputs are merged back.

## Phase 1: Local origin workspace (turn start)

Workspace is created by `ContextBrowser._ensure_workspace()`.

Root resolution (`get_exec_workspace_root()`):
- `EXEC_WORKSPACE_ROOT` if set.
- Docker default: `/exec-workspace`.
- Host fallback: `HOST_EXEC_WORKSPACE_PATH`.
- Final fallback: `/tmp`.

Directory creation pattern:

```text
<exec_workspace_root>/
  ctx_v2_<random>/
    work/
    out/
```

Runtime bindings set immediately:
- `RuntimeCtx.workdir` / `RuntimeCtx.outdir`
- env vars: `WORKDIR`, `OUTPUT_DIR`
- context vars: `WORKDIR_CV`, `OUTDIR_CV`

## Phase 2: What is populated during a normal turn

### Regularly present files/folders in `out/`

`out/` is the main execution surface. Typical content:

```text
ctx_v2_<id>/
  work/
    main.py                                # stable loader executed by isolated runtime
    user_code.py                           # verbatim agent-generated program body/snippet
    ...                                    # helper files generated by execution code
  out/
    timeline.json                          # local timeline snapshot (written frequently)
    tool_calls_index.json                  # tool id -> list of persisted tool call files
    .tool_calls_index.lock                 # lock for index updates
    <safe_tool_id>-<timestamp>.json        # one per tool call payload
    result.json                            # present when generated runtime calls save_ret(...)
    delta_aggregates.json                  # delta cache dump from isolated supervisor/runtime
    executed_programs/                     # preserved executed program sources grouped per execution
      <execution_id>/
        main.py                            # platform loader as actually executed
        user_code.py                       # verbatim agent-generated program body/snippet
    turn_<turn_id>/
      files/                               # turn-scoped file artifacts/rehosted files
      attachments/                         # turn-scoped attachment files
    logs/                                  # isolated runtime logs
      user.log                             # program/user stream (stdout/stderr + logger "user")
      infra.log                            # merged infra view for current execution id
      runtime.err.log                      # raw subprocess capture
      docker.out.log                       # raw outer docker stdout (docker mode)
      docker.err.log                       # raw outer docker stderr (docker mode)
      executor.log                         # executor process logger (mode-dependent)
      supervisor.log                       # supervisor process logger (mode-dependent)
```

Notes:
- Not every file appears on every turn; many are conditional on which tools/runtimes were used.
- `timeline.json` is flushed from the in-memory timeline to keep file-backed context in sync.
- Runtime diagnostics/readouts consume `logs/user.log` and `logs/infra.log`.
- `logs/infra.log` is produced by merging raw infra logs (`runtime.err.log`, `docker.*`, `executor.log`, `supervisor.log`) and may appear only after diagnostics/reporting code runs.
- The current platform-generated raw log set is: `user.log`, `runtime.err.log`, `docker.out.log`, `docker.err.log`, `executor.log`, `supervisor.log`, and derived `infra.log`.
- `runtime.out.log` appears in some older comments/docs but is not part of the current code path.
- `errors.log` is legacy/helper-only and is not part of the current main exec report assembly path.
- The merge step is generic over `*.log` files under `out/logs` except `user.log` and `infra.log`, so extra `.log` files can also appear in `infra.log` if future platform code or custom code writes them there.
- For exec/codegen runs, inspect `executed_programs/<execution_id>/user_code.py` first when debugging what the agent actually wrote. `executed_programs/<execution_id>/main.py` is the platform loader that bootstraps runtime globals and then executes `user_code.py`.

### Path conventions used inside the workspace

Logical `fi:` paths map to physical `out/` paths by convention:
- `fi:<turn_id>.files/<rel>` -> `<turn_id>/files/<rel>`
- `fi:<turn_id>.user.attachments/<rel>` -> `<turn_id>/attachments/<rel>`
- legacy `fi:<turn_id>.attachments/<rel>` -> `<turn_id>/attachments/<rel>`
- `fi:<outdir-relative-path>` -> `<outdir-relative-path>` for any readable file already present under `out/`
  Example: `fi:logs/docker.err.log` -> `logs/docker.err.log`

Other logical paths (`ar:`, `tc:`, `so:`) resolve from timeline state and are not always direct files.

Workspace/read-write summary:
- `react.write`, `react.patch`, rendering tools, and exec outputs write to the current turn file namespace.
- `react.read` can load any readable OUT_DIR file through `fi:...`.
- `react.search_files` can search all of OUT_DIR and returns `logical_path` for OUT_DIR hits so the agent can immediately call `react.read`.
- workdir is searchable but is still not a general-purpose readable namespace for `react.read`.

## Phase 3: Optional turn snapshot persistence (`react.persist_workspace()`)

If `REACT_PERSIST_WORKSPACE` is enabled (default on), ReAct stores zipped diagnostics via `ConversationStore.put_execution_snapshot(...)`:

```text
cb/tenants/<tenant>/projects/<project>/executions/
  <user_type>/<user_or_fp>/<conversation_id>/<turn_id>/<codegen_run_id>/
    out.zip
    pkg.zip
```

Meaning:
- `out.zip` = snapshot of `out/`
- `pkg.zip` = snapshot of `work/`

This is for diagnostics/forensics, not canonical conversation reconstruction.

## Phase 4: Distributed/Fargate workspace serialization and restore

### 4.1 Host-side lightweight snapshot build

Before remote execution, host builds a reduced workspace (`build_exec_snapshot_workspace(...)`):
- copy full `work/`
- create filtered `out/timeline.json`
- include only referenced files required by code (`fetch_ctx`/file refs)
- write `out/exec_snapshot_manifest.json`

Temporary snapshot tree:

```text
/tmp/exec_ws_<random>/
  work/
    ... (copy of local workdir)
  out/
    timeline.json                          # filtered to referenced paths
    exec_snapshot_manifest.json            # included paths summary
    <referenced files only>
```

### 4.2 Storage layout for remote execution

`snapshot_exec_input(...)` uploads snapshot zips to execution-scoped keys:

```text
cb/tenants/<tenant>/projects/<project>/executions/
  <user_type>/<user_or_fp>/<conversation_id>/<turn_id>/<codegen_run_id>/<exec_id>/
    input/work.zip
    input/out.zip
    output/work.zip
    output/out.zip
```

`runtime_globals["EXEC_SNAPSHOT"]` carries these URIs into remote runtime.

Delta packaging conventions (`distributed_snapshot.py` defaults):
- skipped directories: `logs/`, `executed_programs/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.git/`
- skipped files: `sources_pool.json`, `sources_used.json`, `tool_calls_index.json`
- upload is baseline-aware (only changed files since restore are included)

### 4.3 Remote executor workspace (inside Fargate task)

Container runtime paths:

```text
/workspace/
  work/                                    # restored from input/work.zip
  out/                                     # restored from input/out.zip
  bundles/<bundle_dir>/                    # optional bundle restore from BUNDLE_SNAPSHOT_URI
```

`py_code_exec_entry.py` flow:
1. restore input snapshot zips into `/workspace/work` and `/workspace/out`
2. bootstrap supervisor/tool runtime with restored globals and bundle path rewrites
3. execute code
4. upload output zips (`output/work.zip`, `output/out.zip`) as deltas

### 4.4 Merge-back conventions on host after Fargate completion

Host merge behavior (`external/fargate.py`):
- `output/work.zip` -> extracted directly into local `workdir`
- `output/out.zip` -> extracted to temp dir, then selective merge:
  - append `logs/*`
  - copy trees with top-level folder `turn_*`
  - do **not** overwrite `timeline.json` / `sources_pool` directly

This preserves local timeline/sources authority while still importing generated turn artifacts.

## Phase 5: What is canonical vs diagnostic

Canonical conversation state:
- timeline artifacts
- sources pool artifacts
- turn log artifacts
- stored messages/attachments/files

Workspace (`work/` + `out/`) is execution state and diagnostics. Use it for runtime debugging and snapshot transport, not as a long-term source of truth.
