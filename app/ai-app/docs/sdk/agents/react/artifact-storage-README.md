# Artifact Storage Rules

This page describes persistence and hosting. The workspace/ref grammar is in
[ReAct Realm Refs And Workspace Paths](./react-realm-refs-and-workspace-paths-README.md).

## Files vs Tool Results

Tool call/result JSON is stored in timeline/tool-call records such as
`conv:tc:<turn>.<call>.result`, not as ordinary disk files unless a tool also
produces files.

Only these byte-bearing objects are written under the artifact output root:

- exec tool outputs;
- `react.write` file/display artifacts;
- `rendering_tools.write_*` outputs;
- user attachments;
- owner refs materialized by `react.pull`.

## Physical Path Contract

Agent-visible physical paths are always `OUTPUT_DIR`-relative:

```text
turn_<id>/git/projects/<project_scope>/...     # editable durable project state
turn_<id>/files/<artifact_scope>/...           # produced files and deliverables
turn_<id>/git/snapshots/<snapshot_scope>/...    # state snapshots
turn_<id>/attachments/<filename>               # user uploads
turn_<id>/external/<kind>/attachments/<event_id>/<filename>
conv_<conversation_id>/turn_<id>/<area>/<path> # cross-conversation material
```

The agent should not know or mention host/runtime absolute prefixes. In local
runtime storage these paths live under the artifact root, for example
`out/workdir/`.

Logical refs use the `conv:fi:` family:

```text
conv:fi:turn_<id>.git/projects/<project_scope>/<path>
conv:fi:turn_<id>.files/<artifact_scope>/<path>
conv:fi:turn_<id>.git/snapshots/<snapshot_scope>/<path>
conv:fi:turn_<id>.user.attachments/<filename>
conv:fi:turn_<id>.external.<kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<filename>
```

Artifacts never use `current_turn` in stored paths. Always use the concrete
`turn_id`.

## Hosted Storage Location

Assistant-produced file bytes are hosted in conversation file storage under the
current turn. The stored key preserves the full artifact-root-relative path, so
files with the same basename in different directories remain distinct.

General shape:

```text
s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/cb/tenants/<tenant>/projects/<project>/attachments/<user_id>/<conversation_id>/<turn_id>/<artifact-root-relative-path>
```

Example:

```text
physical_path:
  turn_2026-07-04-09-00-00-000/files/analysis/zip_contents.json

logical_path:
  conv:fi:turn_2026-07-04-09-00-00-000.files/analysis/zip_contents.json

storage key:
  cb/tenants/demo/projects/demo/attachments/<user>/<conversation>/
    turn_2026-07-04-09-00-00-000/
    turn_2026-07-04-09-00-00-000/files/analysis/zip_contents.json
```

Visibility controls transport/UI emission, not byte persistence.

## Conversation State Artifacts

Conversation state is stored as conversation artifacts:

- `artifact:conv.timeline.v1` — timeline blocks, conversation metadata, and
  current full `sources_pool`;
- `artifact:conv:sources_pool` — sources pool only;
- `artifact:turn.log` — per-turn block log.

These artifacts are indexed in `conv_messages` with `role = "artifact"` and
tags such as `artifact:conv.timeline.v1`, `artifact:conv:sources_pool`, and
`kind:turn.log`.

## Hosted File Fields

When a file is hosted, metadata blocks include:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rn` | Resource name; primary download/open handle for clients. |
| `hosted_uri` | Backing storage URI, usually S3. |
| `key` | Storage key under the configured bucket/prefix. |
| `logical_path` or `artifact_path` | `conv:fi:` ref. |
| `physical_path` | `OUTPUT_DIR`-relative path. |

These fields are not interchangeable. UI download flows expect `rn`.
`react.pull` uses hosted metadata or the current workspace backend to
materialize bytes. It must not treat a text preview as the complete file.

## Visibility

| Visibility | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `external` | Emitted to the user/client when the transport supports this artifact class. |
| `internal` | Persisted and available to agent/runtime, not emitted as a user artifact. |

Visibility does not decide whether something is project state. Namespace does:

```text
git/projects/... + external/internal  -> project state
files/...        + external/internal  -> produced artifact
git/snapshots/...+ external/internal  -> state snapshot
```

## Kind

Common artifact kinds:

| Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | Byte-bearing file artifact. |
| `display` | Displayable artifact block, often rendered in Artifacts UI. |
| `search_result` | Search-result artifact entry; not a downloadable file unless it also has a file payload. |
| `timeline` | Timeline/progress text; not an Artifacts-tab item. |

Clients should use explicit package/artifact metadata, not namespace guesses,
when deciding whether something belongs in Files, Artifacts, Links, Steps, or
Timeline.

## Example Metadata Block

```json
{
  "artifact_path": "conv:fi:turn_2026-07-04-09-00-00-000.files/report/report.md",
  "physical_path": "turn_2026-07-04-09-00-00-000/files/report/report.md",
  "mime": "text/markdown",
  "kind": "display",
  "visibility": "external",
  "rn": "ef:...:artifact:report.md",
  "hosted_uri": "s3://...",
  "key": "..."
}
```
