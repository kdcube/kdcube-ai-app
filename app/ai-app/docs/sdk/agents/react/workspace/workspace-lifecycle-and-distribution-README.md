# ReAct Workspace Lifecycle & Distribution

This document defines the **actual workspace structure** used by ReAct and how it evolves across phases:
- local turn start (`exec-workspace/exec_<UTC timestamp>_<suffix>`)
- tool execution and artifact population
- optional turn snapshot persistence
- distributed/Fargate serialization, restore, and merge-back

The workspace is execution state. Canonical conversation state still lives in timeline/sources/turn-log artifacts.

Scope:
- this document describes the concrete workspace filesystem and lifecycle
- the agent-facing contract — namespaces (`git/projects/` vs `files/` vs `git/snapshots/`),
  the `[WORKSPACE]` ANNOUNCE map, and pull/checkout — is in
  [workspace-model-README.md](./workspace-model-README.md)

## Effective agent workspace model

The full agent-facing path contract is in
[workspace-model-README.md](./workspace-model-README.md).
This lifecycle doc only names the physical runtime roots and the most important
invariants.

```text
exec_<UTC timestamp>_<suffix>/
  work/                 # internal exec scratch
  out/                  # runtime metadata root
    timeline.json
    tool_calls_index.json
    logs/
    workdir/            # artifact root exposed as OUTPUT_DIR
      turn_<current>/
        git/projects/   # durable workspace/project state
        files/          # produced artifacts, not workspace state
        git/snapshots/      # story/workflow snapshots
        attachments/    # user attachments
        external/...    # rehosted external/followup/domain attachments
      turn_<older>/...  # pulled same-conversation history
      conv_<conversation_id>/turn_<older>/...
                           # pulled cross-conversation history
```

Current behavior:
- History is preserved physically under `out/workdir/turn_<id>/...`; cross-conversation refs materialize under `out/workdir/conv_<conversation_id>/turn_<id>/...`.
- Writes for the current turn go to:
  - `out/workdir/<current_turn>/git/projects/...` for durable workspace/project state
  - `out/workdir/<current_turn>/files/...` for non-workspace produced artifacts
- Reads can target:
  - versioned turn artifacts and attachments
  - any readable artifact file already present under `out/workdir/`
- External owner refs such as `nmsp:`, `cnv:`, or `mem:` have no physical path
  until `react.pull` invokes a registered namespace rehoster and returns the
  materialized `conv:fi:` / physical rows.

Workspace implementation (`RuntimeCtx.workspace_implementation`):
- `custom`
  - the agent is taught to use `conv:fi:` plus `react.pull(paths=[...])` for historical materialization and `react.checkout(paths=[...])` for copying pulled `git/projects/...` refs into the active current-turn workspace
  - `.git/projects/...` and `.files/...` pulls hydrate from artifact/timeline metadata and hosted blobs
  - the agent is not instructed to treat the activated workspace as git
- `git`
  - the agent is taught to use `conv:fi:` plus `react.pull(paths=[...])` for historical materialization and `react.checkout(paths=[...])` for copying pulled `git/projects/...` refs into the active current-turn workspace
  - `.git/projects/...` pulls hydrate from git-backed lineage snapshots
  - the current turn root `out/workdir/<current_turn>/` is bootstrapped as a local git repo
  - that current-turn repo keeps lineage history available but does not eagerly populate the worktree
  - ANNOUNCE may show `previous saved workspace paths (pull to bring local; checkout to edit)` so React can see prior saved workspace paths without mistaking them for the current editable workspace
  - the agent may use local git inspection/history/edit commands inside that current-turn repo, except pull/push/fetch
- in both modes:
  - `react.pull` materializes refs as historical/reference material
  - `react.checkout` copies selected `conv:fi:...git/projects...` refs into the active current-turn `git/projects/` workspace
  - folder pulls expand from timeline/git metadata and fetch exact hosted blobs; they do not list storage buckets or extract execution snapshots
  - in `git` mode, exact non-text `.files/...` refs that resolve to hosted artifacts are still hydrated from artifact/hosting history, not from git

### Namespace-owned files and exec-time path resolution

Bundle-owned files are not exposed through a generic ReAct-readable knowledge
space. If generated code needs to inspect namespace-owned bytes or directory-like
content, the owning bundle must provide an explicit resolver, rehoster, tool,
MCP/search surface, or named-service operation that enforces the current auth
context.

When such a resolver exists, the generated code flow is:
1. start from a namespace-owned logical ref such as `task:...`
2. call the owner-provided resolver or service operation
3. receive an exec-local physical path or a byte stream scoped to that request
4. inspect the content for discovery only
5. emit owner refs or hosted file refs back into OUTPUT_DIR artifacts or short
   logs so the agent can later use the correct owner API or `react.read` on
   normal `conv:fi:`/`conv:tc:`/`conv:ar:` artifacts

## Lifecycle at a glance

1. ReAct creates a fresh per-turn workspace directory (`exec_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_ab12`, timestamped in UTC) with `work/` and `out/`.
2. During the turn, tools and runtime write files into `out/` (and sometimes `work/`).
   User-visible artifacts are under `out/workdir`; runtime metadata/logs stay directly under `out`.
3. Optionally, `react.persist_workspace()` stores zipped `out`/`work` for diagnostics.
4. For distributed/Fargate exec, a lightweight snapshot is built, uploaded, restored remotely, then outputs are merged back.

## Phase 1: Local origin workspace (turn start)

Workspace is created by `ContextBrowser._ensure_workspace()`.

Root resolution (`get_exec_workspace_root()`):
- `EXEC_WORKSPACE_ROOT` if set.
- Docker default: `/exec-workspace`.
- Host fallback: `HOST_EXEC_WORKSPACE_PATH`.
- Final fallback: `/tmp`.

Directory creation pattern:

```text
<exec_workspace_root>/
  exec_20260506125243_ab12/
    work/
    out/
```

Runtime bindings set immediately:
- `RuntimeCtx.workdir` / `RuntimeCtx.outdir` (`outdir` is the runtime metadata root)
- env vars: `WORKDIR`, `OUTPUT_DIR`
- context vars: `WORKDIR_CV`, `OUTDIR_CV`

Important:
- generated code and isolated rendering tools see `OUTPUT_DIR` as the artifact
  root, i.e. `out/workdir` in local runtime storage
- the platform uses the runtime output root `out` for metadata (`timeline.json`,
  `tool_calls_index.json`, tool-call JSON, logs, diagnostics)
- the agent should only use `turn_...` paths relative to `OUTPUT_DIR`; it should
  never use absolute host paths or `out/workdir` prefixes in tool params

When `workspace_implementation=git`:
- runtime also bootstraps `out/workdir/turn_<current_turn>/` as a local git repo
- if the lineage branch already exists, that repo starts from the latest lineage head
- runtime keeps the repo history/refs available but leaves the worktree empty until the agent explicitly materializes files
- if the lineage branch does not exist yet, runtime creates an empty orphan repo for the turn
- engineering, not exec, is responsible for later remote synchronization

## Phase 2: What is populated during a normal turn

### Regularly present files/folders in `out/`

`out/` is the main execution surface. Typical content:

```text
exec_20260506125243_ab12/
  work/
    main.py                                # stable loader executed by isolated runtime
    user_code.py                           # verbatim agent-generated program body/snippet
    ...                                    # helper files generated by execution code
  out/
    timeline.json                          # local timeline snapshot (written frequently)
    tool_calls_index.json                  # tool id -> list of persisted tool call files
    .tool_calls_index.lock                 # lock for index updates
    <safe_tool_id>-<timestamp>.json        # one per tool call payload
    result.json                            # present when generated runtime calls save_ret(...)
    delta_aggregates.json                  # delta cache dump from isolated supervisor/runtime
    executed_programs/                     # preserved executed program sources grouped per execution
      <execution_id>/
        main.py                            # platform loader as actually executed
        user_code.py                       # verbatim agent-generated program body/snippet
    workdir/                               # artifact root exposed as OUTPUT_DIR
      turn_<turn_id>/
        git/projects/                      # durable workspace/project state
        files/                             # non-workspace produced artifacts
        git/snapshots/                         # story/workflow snapshots
        attachments/                       # turn-scoped user attachment files
        external/<event_kind>/attachments/... # external-event attachments, e.g. followup
      conv_<conversation_id>/               # pulled artifacts from another conversation
        turn_<turn_id>/
          git/projects/
          files/
          git/snapshots/
    logs/                                  # isolated runtime logs
      user.log                             # program/user stream (stdout/stderr + logger "user")
      infra.log                            # merged infra view for current execution id
      runtime.err.log                      # raw subprocess capture
      docker.out.log                       # raw outer docker stdout (docker mode)
      docker.err.log                       # raw outer docker stderr (docker mode)
      executor.log                         # executor process logger (mode-dependent)
      supervisor.log                       # supervisor process logger (mode-dependent)
```

Notes:
- Not every file appears on every turn; many are conditional on which tools/runtimes were used.
- `timeline.json` is flushed from the in-memory timeline to keep file-backed context in sync.
- Runtime diagnostics/readouts consume `logs/user.log` and `logs/infra.log`.
- `logs/infra.log` is produced by merging raw infra logs (`runtime.err.log`, `docker.*`, `executor.log`, `supervisor.log`) and may appear only after diagnostics/reporting code runs.
- The current platform-generated raw log set is: `user.log`, `runtime.err.log`, `docker.out.log`, `docker.err.log`, `executor.log`, `supervisor.log`, and derived `infra.log`.
- `runtime.out.log` appears in some older comments/docs but is not part of the current code path.
- `errors.log` is legacy/helper-only and is not part of the current main exec report assembly path.
- The merge step is generic over `*.log` files under `out/logs` except `user.log` and `infra.log`, so extra `.log` files can also appear in `infra.log` if future platform code or custom code writes them there.
- For exec/codegen runs, inspect `executed_programs/<execution_id>/user_code.py` first when debugging what the agent actually wrote. `executed_programs/<execution_id>/main.py` is the platform loader that bootstraps runtime globals and then executes `user_code.py`.

### Path conventions used inside the workspace

The full `conv:fi:` grammar, custom namespace rules, and pull/checkout contract live
in [artifact-namespace-rehosters-README.md](artifact-namespace-rehosters-README.md).
This runtime article only needs the operational shape:

```text
OUTPUT_DIR/
  turn_<current>/
    git/projects/... # editable workspace/project state
    files/...        # produced artifacts, reports, render sources, diagnostics
    git/snapshots/...   # story/workflow state snapshots
    attachments/... # user uploads for this turn
  turn_<older>/...  # pulled same-conversation references
  conv_<conversation_id>/turn_<older>/...
                   # pulled cross-conversation references
```

Workspace/read-write summary:
- `react.write`, `react.patch`, rendering tools, and exec outputs may write to
  `turn_<current>/git/projects/...` or `turn_<current>/files/...`.
- Use `git/projects/...` for durable workspace/project state; use `files/...`
  for generated artifacts that should not become editable project state.
- `react.pull` materializes selected same-turn, older-turn, cross-conversation,
  or custom-namespace refs into `OUTPUT_DIR`.
- `react.checkout` copies pulled historical `git/projects/...` refs into the active
  current-turn `git/projects/` workspace for editing.
- Custom refs such as `nmsp:...`, `cnv:...`, or `mem:...` have no derived local path. `react.pull` calls a
  registered namespace rehoster and its result tells the agent the materialized
  `conv:fi:` path.
- `react.rg` searches readable files already materialized in `OUTPUT_DIR`; it is
  not a search over unpulled history.
- `work/` is internal execution scratch and is not part of the normal React search/read contract.

## Phase 3: Optional turn snapshot persistence (`react.persist_workspace()`)

If `REACT_PERSIST_WORKSPACE` is enabled (default on), ReAct stores zipped diagnostics via `ConversationStore.put_execution_snapshot(...)`:

```text
cb/tenants/<tenant>/projects/<project>/executions/
  <user_or_fp>/<conversation_id>/<turn_id>/<codegen_run_id>/<codegen_run_id>.zip
```

Meaning:
- the archive contains top-level `out/` and `pkg/` trees
- `out/` is the runtime output root
- `pkg/` is the generated execution package/work tree

This is for diagnostics/forensics, not canonical conversation reconstruction.
`react.pull` uses hosted artifact bytes recorded in timeline metadata; it does
not extract files from these diagnostic snapshots.

## Phase 4: Distributed/Fargate workspace serialization and restore

Local split Docker execution keeps the same distinction as remote snapshots:
the runtime output root owns `timeline.json`, sources, logs, and runtime
metadata, while the artifact root (`out/workdir` locally, `/workspace/out` in
the executor container) is exposed to generated code as `OUTPUT_DIR`.
`ctx_tools.fetch_ctx` reads logical timeline refs from the runtime output root
first and only falls back to the artifact root for legacy layouts.

### 4.1 Host-side lightweight snapshot build

Before remote execution, host builds a reduced workspace (`build_exec_snapshot_workspace(...)`):
- copy full `work/`
- create filtered `out/timeline.json`
- include only referenced files required by code (`fetch_ctx`/file refs)
- if any referenced file belongs to a git-backed turn root, copy the whole artifact-root `turn_<id>/` tree so `.git` survives in isolated exec
- write `out/exec_snapshot_manifest.json`

Temporary snapshot tree:

```text
/tmp/exec_ws_<random>/
  work/
    ... (copy of local workdir)
  out/
    timeline.json                          # filtered to referenced paths
    exec_snapshot_manifest.json            # included paths summary
    workdir/
      <referenced turn_... artifact files only>
```

### 4.2 Storage layout for remote execution

`snapshot_exec_input(...)` uploads snapshot zips to execution-scoped keys:

```text
cb/tenants/<tenant>/projects/<project>/executions/
  <user_type>/<user_or_fp>/<conversation_id>/<turn_id>/<codegen_run_id>/<exec_id>/
    input/work.zip
    input/out.zip
    output/work.zip
    output/out.zip
```

`runtime_globals["EXEC_SNAPSHOT"]` carries these URIs into remote runtime.

Delta packaging conventions (`distributed_snapshot.py` defaults):
- skipped directories: `logs/`, `executed_programs/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.git/`
- skipped files: `sources_pool.json`, `sources_used.json`, `tool_calls_index.json`
- upload is baseline-aware (only changed files since restore are included)

### 4.3 Remote executor workspace (inside Fargate task)

Container runtime paths:

```text
/workspace/
  work/                                    # restored from input/work.zip
  runtime-out/                             # runtime metadata/logs in split mode
  out/                                     # artifact root exposed as OUTPUT_DIR inside the executor
  bundles/<bundle_dir>/                    # optional bundle restore from BUNDLE_SNAPSHOT_URI
```

`py_code_exec_entry.py` flow:
1. restore input snapshot zips into `/workspace/work` and `/workspace/out`
2. bootstrap supervisor/tool runtime with restored globals and bundle path rewrites
3. execute code
4. upload output zips (`output/work.zip`, `output/out.zip`) as deltas

### 4.4 Merge-back conventions on host after Fargate completion

Host merge behavior (`external/fargate.py`):
- `output/work.zip` -> extracted directly into local `workdir`
- `output/out.zip` -> extracted to temp dir, then selective merge:
  - append `logs/*`
  - copy artifact trees with top-level folder `turn_*` into the local artifact root
  - do **not** overwrite `timeline.json` / `sources_pool` directly

This preserves local timeline/sources authority while still importing generated turn artifacts.

## Phase 5: What is canonical vs diagnostic

Canonical conversation state:
- timeline artifacts
- sources pool artifacts
- turn log artifacts
- stored messages/attachments/files

Workspace (`work/` + `out/`) is execution state and diagnostics. Use it for runtime debugging and snapshot transport, not as a long-term source of truth.
