# Announce Production Phase

`announce_production` is the phase for non-durable ReAct tail material. During
render, ReAct asks registered event sources for ANNOUNCE blocks and appends the
result after cache markers.

ANNOUNCE is not timeline history. It is computed for the current decision render
and appended after cache markers. If ANNOUNCE needs current story state, the
harness should call a registered source/materializer that reads authoritative
state and returns or writes a snapshot artifact/ref.

## Target Shape

The target is a mutable list of ANNOUNCE tail blocks. Policies receive
access to the full timeline through context because a source may decide whether
to announce based on recency, story focus, last occurrence, or snapshot state.

## Snapshot Rule

Snapshots are not reconstructed by replaying the timeline. Timeline blocks are
event history and refs. Snapshot materialization is a source/tool responsibility
and should write a ref such as:

```text
conv:fi:<turn_id>.git/snapshots/<name>
conv:fi:conv_<conversation_id>.<turn_id>.git/snapshots/<name>
```

The `conv_...` segment means the referenced artifact belongs to another
conversation. Current-conversation refs normally omit that segment.

## Runtime Contract

- ANNOUNCE production runs from `Timeline._append_tail_blocks()` when
  `include_announce=True`.
- The policy target is not persisted. It is a render-tail block list.
- The policy receives a cloned timeline context. It must treat that context as
  read-only and append only ANNOUNCE blocks to the target.
- Cache markers are selected before the tail is appended, so ANNOUNCE blocks are
  non-cached.
- The render token probe uses the same ANNOUNCE production path as the final
  render, so large ANNOUNCE blocks can still trigger compaction.

## Owner Retention Contract

ANNOUNCE policies are the right place for owner-defined volatile context. A
policy may decide that a recently attached or read object should be shown for
only a bounded number of render rounds. The rendered section must say how long
it remains visible and how to refresh it.

Canvas is the reference example:

```text
[CANVAS BOARD]
visibility: 3/3 render rounds remaining; use react.pull(paths=['cnv:main']) and react.read on the returned conv:fi: path if you need it updated/prolonged.
```

Two different event sources can legitimately refer to the same board in one
turn:

```text
chat.canvas.state  -> user/UI attached the board as context
canvas.read        -> agent read a pulled canvas snapshot
```

They should not produce duplicate ANNOUNCE sections for the same board. The
owner announce policy should consolidate by object identity and render one
current section, preferring the freshest read/state payload according to its
policy. This is not a generic ReAct rule; it belongs to the owner policy
because only the owner knows whether two refs identify the same volatile
object.
