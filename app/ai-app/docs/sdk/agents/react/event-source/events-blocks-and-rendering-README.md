# Events, Blocks, And ReAct Rendering

This page maps where events become timeline blocks and where those blocks are
projected for model-visible context. The policy layer must respect the existing
ReAct render order:

```text
persistent timeline blocks
    -> TTL pruning / compaction window selection
    -> timeline_projection on a phase-local render view
    -> hidden replacements
    -> render directives
    -> cache markers
    -> non-cached tail: sources pool + ANNOUNCE
    -> model message blocks
```

ANNOUNCE is tail material. It is recomputed for the decision render and appended
after cache markers. It is not stored as a normal timeline block unless a
separate materializer writes a durable artifact/ref.

Owner-object reads can participate in both worlds. The read policy may append a
compact durable timeline fact, while the ANNOUNCE policy renders a bounded live
projection from metadata on that fact. Canvas uses this pattern: `canvas.read`
stores a compact read fact, and the canvas announce policy renders the board
map for a limited number of render rounds.

## Phase Matrix

| # | Spot | Current implementation | `tool_call_validation` | `block_production` | `timeline_projection` | `announce_production` | `compaction_projection` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | User prompt event projection | Lane fold in `browser.py` delegates to built-in block-production policies. | Not applicable. | Accepted type is `event.user.prompt`; `react.block_production.user_prompt_default` emits `user.prompt`. | Existing renderer handles visible text at the `conv:ar:<turn>.user.prompt...` path. | Current user context can be mentioned separately. | Existing summary selection includes it. | Implemented built-in user event source. |
| 2 | User attachment event projection | Lane fold delegates to `react.block_production.user_attachment_default`, which uses `build_user_attachment_blocks()` in `layout.py`. | Not applicable. | Accepted type family is `event.user.attachment.*`; default production emits `user.attachment.meta` plus optional binary/text blocks and preserves hosted metadata. | Existing render directives and binary caps apply. | No source policy yet. | Existing compaction keeps refs/metadata through normal logic. | Implemented built-in user attachment event source. |
| 3 | Event lane arrival | `ContextBrowser.apply_external_events()` in `browser.py` | Not applicable. | Arrival checks consume/deflect events. | Not projected at arrival. | Not involved. | Not involved. | Transport-owned, not policy-owned. |
| 4 | Accepted event to timeline blocks | `_blocks_from_external_event()` in `browser.py` delegates accepted event occurrences to block-production policies. | Not applicable. | Registered event sources can override `block_production`; unregistered sources fall back to SDK defaults. Built-in user events emit `user.prompt`, `user.followup`, `user.steer`, and `user.attachment.*`; generic/domain/snapshot/canvas events emit one event block at the `conv:ev:` path. The event body carries `ok/status/error/ret` plus extracted standard `surfaces` such as source rows, artifact rows, snapshot refs, announce candidates, and notices. | Stamped blocks can be addressed by policy. | Future source/story policies can add tail material. | Future source/story policies can preserve or replace. | Implemented for accepted events; no registration is required for default blocks. |
| 5 | Current-turn deferral | `_fold_external_events_initial()` / `_fold_external_events()` in `browser.py` | Not applicable. | Defers current-turn events before contribution. | Preserves owner turn before projection. | Not involved. | Not involved. | Keep this ownership rule. |
| 6 | Contribution filtering | `_filter_contribution_blocks()` and timeline contribution in `browser.py` | Not applicable. | Filters duplicate/invalid contributed blocks. | Projection sees only contributed blocks. | Not involved. | Compaction sees contributed blocks. | Event metadata must be attached before final contribution. |
| 7 | ReAct round blocks | `ReactRound.start()`, `thinking()`, `note()`, `decision_raw()` in `round.py` | Not applicable. | Harness-owned blocks. | Existing renderer handles them. | Not source-materialized. | Existing compaction preserves compact round metadata. | Keep as harness blocks. |
| 8 | Tool call validation | `handle_external_tool()` after `ref:` binding and before `tool_call_block()` | Policies can mutate `final_params`, emit notices/blocks, update state, or stop/retry. | Not result production. | Not visible projection. | Not announce. | Not compaction. | Implemented for exec and rendering input preparation. |
| 9 | Tool call block | `tool_call_block()` in `tools/common.py` | Validation has already run. | Harness emits generic `react.tool.call`; feature flag can stamp event identity. | Renderer handles `react.tool.call`; policies can target it later. | Not yet used. | Existing compaction still has hardcoded tool-call handling. | Tool-call production stays harness-owned. |
| 10 | Tool result/artifact blocks | `handle_external_tool()` plus artifact helpers | Already completed before execution. | Source-specific policies produce result rows, artifact rows, declared-file rows, source rows, and notice rows before shared builders create final blocks. | Phase-local render policies can mutate stamped blocks before cache markers. | Source policies can inspect timeline and append tail blocks. | Phase-local compaction policies can mutate selected blocks before summary/preservation. | Block production works for external SDK tools under the flag; old path remains fallback. |
| 11 | Sources pool | Tool result handlers and `timeline.sources_pool` | Already after validation. | Search/fetch use `react.block_production.exploration_results`; rows merge into `sources_pool`. | Sources pool is rendered as tail, not as durable timeline history. | Sources can influence announce only through explicit announce policy. | Sources pool is not compacted as timeline history. | Implemented for `web_search` and `web_fetch`. |
| 12 | ANNOUNCE construction | `build_announce_text()` plus event-source ANNOUNCE tail in `_append_tail_blocks()` | Not applicable. | Not durable block production. | Not timeline projection. | Registered source policies append ephemeral tail blocks when `include_announce=True`. | Not compaction. | Implemented as non-cached, non-durable render tail. |
| 13 | Render probe before compaction | `_render_locked()` in `timeline.py` | Not applicable. | Uses already-produced blocks. | Uses the same phase-local projection path as final render, so projection affects token pressure. | Uses the same ANNOUNCE tail path as final render, so ANNOUNCE affects pressure. | Probe precedes compaction choice. | Keep projections bounded. |
| 14 | Cache TTL segmentation | `apply_cache_ttl_pruning()` in `session.py` | Not applicable. | Uses persisted blocks. | Feature-flagged phase call exists after temporary `_react_timeline_segment` marks are patched. | Not involved. | Not involved. | Default hardcoded pruning remains. |
| 15 | Compaction trigger and cut | `sanitize_context_blocks()` in `timeline.py` | Not applicable. | Uses persisted blocks. | Render path already happened earlier. | Not involved. | Feature-flagged phase seam exists for mutable compaction views. | Preservation logic remains partly hardcoded. |
| 16 | Compaction history selection | `_is_meaningful_compaction_history_block()` and summarizer input | Not applicable. | Uses selected blocks. | Not involved. | Not involved. | Policies can hide, replace, or summarize selected block views before summarizer input. | Structural defaults compact external/snapshot/canvas JSON into event facts. |
| 17 | Compaction preservation | `_build_compacted_external_event_blocks()` / `_build_compacted_round_blocks()` | Not applicable. | Uses produced blocks. | Not involved. | Not involved. | Still hardcodes followup/steer and tool-round preservation. | Replace with event-source policies later. |
| 18 | Slice after compaction summary | `_slice_after_compaction_summary()` in `timeline.py` | Not applicable. | Uses persisted blocks and summary range. | Hidden/replacement state is rendered after slicing. | Not involved. | Must leave discoverable refs for material that should survive summaries. | Keep refs explicit. |
| 19 | Hidden replacements | `_apply_hidden_replacements()` in `timeline.py` | Not applicable. | Uses persisted blocks plus phase-local projection decisions. | Policies can set `hidden` and `replacement_text` before hidden replacement rendering. | Not involved. | Same fields can guide compaction projection. | `react.timeline_projection.hide_by_segment` exists. |
| 20 | Render directives | `_apply_render_directives_before_cache()` and `build_timeline_render_directive()` | Not applicable. | Uses already-shaped blocks. | Consumes policy decisions; does not discover sources. | Not involved. | Not involved. | Final render hygiene layer. |
| 21 | Cache marker assignment | `_apply_cache_markers()` in `timeline.py` | Not applicable. | Uses visible timeline blocks. | Must run only after projection so cache points are stable. | ANNOUNCE is appended after cache markers. | Not involved. | Preserve existing cache strategy. |
| 22 | Tail append | `_append_tail_blocks()` in `timeline.py` | Not applicable. | Not persistent production. | Sources/announce tail appended after projection and cache markers. | ANNOUNCE policies are called here and appended after static announce blocks. | Not involved. | Tail is non-cached and non-durable unless separately materialized. |
| 23 | Block-to-message rendering | `_blocks_to_message_blocks()` in `timeline.py` | Not applicable. | Consumes typed blocks. | Converts already-decided blocks to model-visible messages. | Converts tail blocks too. | Not involved. | No source lookup here. |
| 24 | Turn finalization | `_exit_node()` in `v3/runtime.py` | Not applicable. | Stores `react.turn.finalize`, clears ANNOUNCE, appends state/exit. | Later renders normally. | Clears ephemeral announce state. | Existing compaction can summarize finalization. | Story state persists separately. |
| 25 | Persistence and recovery | Timeline persistence and read/search tools | Not applicable. | Persists timeline blocks and sources pool. | Later read/search sees durable blocks/refs. | ANNOUNCE is not persisted. | Compacted blocks/refs become recovery anchors. | Snapshot refs and cross-conversation paths must remain durable. |

| Custom structured tools | `tool_call_id` | Structured JSON/text/file result blocks | Optional source policy. | Default structured policy pack when no declaration is found. | Identity unless declared otherwise. | Pending. | Identity unless declared otherwise. |

## File Preview Rule

Artifact rows are not the same as preview text. A file-producing source can
produce only metadata/artifact rows, and that is enough for the model to see
the logical artifact path. ReAct should call `react.read` when it needs the
file content.

When a source has already projected bounded file text during block production,
it may emit `text_preview` and mark the artifact text block with
`meta.projection.format="text_file_preview.v1"` plus
`meta.projection.already_rendered=true`. The renderer preserves that text as
the source-owned projection. Unmarked artifact text is treated as raw text and
may be wrapped with the standard line-window and line-number rendering.

## Cache And Segment Rules

Timeline/compaction policies operate on already-produced blocks. For cold-cache
or TTL pruning paths, the caller patches temporary segment metadata before
invoking policy handlers:

```text
meta._react_timeline_segment = current | intact_recent | recent | old | compacted
```

That mark is phase-local. The caller must remove it after policy application.
Policy-produced durable changes, such as `hidden` or `replacement_text`, remain.
Cache markers are assigned after timeline projection and before tail material is
appended. Policies must not change this ordering.
