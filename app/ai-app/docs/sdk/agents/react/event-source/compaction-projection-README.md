# Compaction Projection Phase

`compaction_projection` runs on already-produced blocks selected for
compaction/summarization. Policies can decide how a source should be exposed to
the summarizer, which refs must survive, and which block families should be
hidden or replaced before compaction text is built.

The target is a mutable block list. Policies mutate blocks inline.

## Current Policies

| Policy ID | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `react.compaction_projection.identity` | Leaves blocks unchanged. |
| `react.compaction_projection.hide_by_segment` | Same implementation as timeline hide-by-segment, applied in the compaction phase. |

## Open Work

Some preservation logic is still hardcoded, especially built-in user-event
preservation (`event.user.followup`, `event.user.steer`) and tool-round
preservation. The desired direction is to move that behavior into event-source
policies so custom event sources can define their own compaction shape without
editing ReAct core.

Compaction policies should preserve durable recovery anchors. For story
snapshots and cross-conversation recovery, leave explicit refs such as
`fi:<turn>.snapshots/...` or `fi:conv_<conversation_id>.<turn>.snapshots/...`
visible enough for later `react.read`, `react.pull`, or `react.checkout`.

## Volatile ANNOUNCE Is Not Preservation

ANNOUNCE blocks are prompt-tail projections and are not persisted as timeline
history. A retention-limited board map, wizard state, or other live view should
not be preserved by compaction just because it was announced. The durable
recovery anchor is the timeline fact or snapshot ref that produced it.

For canvas, compaction should preserve refs/facts such as `cnv:main`,
`cnv:main@52`, or the pulled `fi:...snapshots/cnv/...json` path when they are
relevant. It should not treat the rendered `[CANVAS BOARD]` ANNOUNCE text as
authoritative state.
