# React System Instruction

This page explains the system instruction seen by the React decision agent.
It is also the checklist for deciding whether a lite/custom instruction body is
complete for the tools and runtime surfaces exposed by a bundle.

## Composition

The full decision system text is assembled in
`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.react.decision_prompt`.

```text
v2/v3 decision agent
  -> version-specific strict channel protocol
  -> instruction body
       1. instruction_body, if supplied
       2. composed instruction_blocks, if supplied
       3. extended/default body, otherwise
  -> optional tool catalog
  -> optional skill catalog
  -> optional agent-admin customization block
```

The strict channel protocol is not customizable. The runtime parser depends on
it. Bundle authors customize the instruction body below that protocol.

The tool catalog and skill catalog are not substitutes for the instruction
body. They tell the model what is currently available. The instruction body
explains how to behave with the React timeline, ANNOUNCE, logical paths,
workspace, recovery paths, tools, memory, and finalization.

### Cache Consequence

The composed system instruction is part of the exact model-input prefix. It is
not a timeline block, but it still affects the prompt prefix that React sends
before the rendered timeline.

```
[strict protocol]
[instruction body]
[tool/skill catalog]
[admin or runtime customization]
[rendered timeline prefix]
[ANNOUNCE / current tail]
```

Changing any bytes before the rendered timeline creates a different downstream
prompt prefix. In the current ReAct decision path, the tool catalog and skill
catalog are text rendered in this system instruction, usually near the bottom.
Changing them changes the system prefix before the rendered timeline. A
per-user customization suffix therefore prevents cross-user cache sharing for
that agent after that suffix. A subagent with a different instruction has its
own cache story. Put volatile current state in ANNOUNCE or another tail block
instead of appending it to the instruction body.

React maps this prefix layout to explicit cache controls for Anthropic/Claude.
For other providers, the same prompt layout still controls token shape and
semantic stability, but React does not currently assume equivalent
provider-side cache-control behavior.

The important boundary is the first changed segment:

```
[strict protocol]                         stable for all compatible agents
[default React instruction]               stable for all compatible agents
[shared bundle/domain instruction]        stable for this bundle/config

--- first variable segment below this line limits cache sharing ---

[per-user instruction suffix]             differs by user
[selected tool catalog]                   differs if user/runtime changes tools
[selected skill catalog]                  differs if user/runtime changes skills
[rendered timeline prefix]                downstream of the variable segments
[ANNOUNCE / current tail]                 intentionally uncached
```

If the tool catalog or skill catalog is rendered inside the instruction
envelope, it is part of the cache prefix. Letting a user select tools or skills
therefore partitions the cache by that exact selection. Changing the selection
between turns invalidates the downstream cache for that user. Changing it
between rounds is worse: the same turn can no longer reuse cache points after
the changed catalog segment.

Keep the instruction envelope stable when cache sharing matters. Put changing
current state in ANNOUNCE. Only put tool/skill catalogs in the instruction
envelope when the model really needs that catalog for the current call, and
expect the cache to be keyed by the exact catalog text.

Be explicit about the reuse scope:

- Same user reuse: later turns, later rounds, or repeated calls to the same
  configured subagent can reuse cache only while that user's instruction/catalog
  prefix stays identical.
- Cross-user reuse: multiple users can share the common prefix only before any
  per-user instruction, per-user data, or user-selected catalog segment. This is
  valuable on Anthropic because traffic from multiple users is more likely to
  keep a short-lived cache entry hot.
- Subagent reuse: a subagent configured dynamically by the main agent is usually
  a cache story inside that user's work. A ready-made/static subagent can share
  its common prefix across users until the first user-specific segment.

## Use The Extended Default

If a bundle does not pass custom instruction fields, React uses the extended
default body from `shared_instructions.py`.

```python
react = self.build_react(
    scratchpad=scratchpad,
    mod_tools_spec=tools_descriptor,
)
```

This is the broadest current instruction set. It is the right default for
general-purpose, full-capability agents.

## Use A Lite Profile

Lite instruction blocks live in `shared_instructions_lite.py`. The helper below
returns an instruction body only. The version-specific protocol, tool catalog,
skill catalog, and admin customization are still added by React.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.skills.instructions.shared_instructions_lite import (
    default_lite_system_instruction,
)

react = self.build_react(
    scratchpad=scratchpad,
    mod_tools_spec=tools_descriptor,
    instruction_body=default_lite_system_instruction("workspace_exec"),
    include_tool_catalog=True,
    include_skill_gallery=True,
)
```

Available profiles:

| Profile | Intended Use |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Minimal React operation: timeline, ANNOUNCE, live events, paths, read recovery, workspace model, skills, attachments, citations, finalization. |
| `workspace` | Core plus common React workspace tools: write, memsearch, rg, pull/checkout, patch, and plan. |
| `workspace_exec` | Workspace plus isolated exec guidance. |
| `document` | Workspace plus rendering-tool guidance. |
| `web` | Workspace plus web search/fetch guidance. |
| `all_capabilities` | All lite blocks, including internal notes and durable user memory. Use only when those tools and policies are enabled. |

## Compose Blocks Directly

Use `instruction_blocks` when the bundle wants a selected set of named lite
blocks plus custom literal blocks. Named blocks are resolved from
`shared_instructions_lite.py`; unknown strings are treated as literal
instruction text.

```python
react = self.build_react(
    scratchpad=scratchpad,
    mod_tools_spec=tools_descriptor,
    instruction_blocks=[
        "REACT_LITE_IDENTITY",
        "REACT_LITE_SECURITY_GUARD",
        "REACT_LITE_TIMELINE_CONTEXT",
        "REACT_LITE_ANNOUNCE",
        "REACT_LITE_EXTERNAL_EVENTS",
        "REACT_LITE_DECISION_LOOP",
        "REACT_LITE_TOOL_USE_BASE",
        "REACT_LITE_PATHS_AND_NAMESPACES",
        "REACT_LITE_REACT_READ_RECOVERY",
        "REACT_LITE_WORKSPACE_BASE",
        "REACT_LITE_FILES_VS_OUTPUTS",
        "REACT_LITE_FINALIZATION",
        "[BUNDLE-SPECIFIC RULES]\nAnswer only from the visible docs and fetched sources.",
    ],
)
```

The same fields can be provided through bundle config:

```yaml
react:
  instructions:
    blocks:
      - REACT_LITE_IDENTITY
      - REACT_LITE_SECURITY_GUARD
      - REACT_LITE_TIMELINE_CONTEXT
      - REACT_LITE_ANNOUNCE
      - REACT_LITE_EXTERNAL_EVENTS
      - REACT_LITE_DECISION_LOOP
      - REACT_LITE_TOOL_USE_BASE
      - REACT_LITE_PATHS_AND_NAMESPACES
      - REACT_LITE_REACT_READ_RECOVERY
      - REACT_LITE_WORKSPACE_BASE
      - REACT_LITE_FILES_VS_OUTPUTS
      - REACT_LITE_FINALIZATION
    include_tool_catalog: true
    include_skill_gallery: true
```

Or as a complete body:

```yaml
react:
  instructions:
    body: |
      [REACT IDENTITY]
      You are the decision module inside a KDCube React loop.

      [BUNDLE-SPECIFIC RULES]
      Answer from the visible docs and fetched sources only.
    include_tool_catalog: true
    include_skill_gallery: true
```

`react.instructions.*` and `config.react.instructions.*` are both accepted by
`build_react`. A complete `body` has priority over `blocks`.

## Completeness Checklist

A lite body is complete when it covers every runtime signal and every exposed
capability for that agent. It does not need to be textually identical to the
extended/default body.

Minimum baseline for most React agents:

- strict v2/v3 protocol is still prepended by the decision agent
- `REACT_LITE_IDENTITY`
- `REACT_LITE_SECURITY_GUARD`
- `REACT_LITE_TIMELINE_CONTEXT`
- `REACT_LITE_ANNOUNCE`
- `REACT_LITE_EXTERNAL_EVENTS`
- `REACT_LITE_DECISION_LOOP`
- `REACT_LITE_TOOL_USE_BASE`
- `REACT_LITE_USER_BOUNDARIES_AND_FAILURES`
- `REACT_LITE_PATHS_AND_NAMESPACES`
- `REACT_LITE_REACT_READ_RECOVERY`
- `REACT_LITE_WORKSPACE_BASE`
- `REACT_LITE_FILES_VS_OUTPUTS`
- `REACT_LITE_FINALIZATION`
- tool catalog enabled when tools are exposed
- skill catalog enabled when skills are exposed

Then add capability blocks only for tools/policies that are actually exposed:

| Exposed Capability | Required Lite Block |
| --- | --- |
| `react.write` for artifacts | `REACT_LITE_REACT_WRITE_ARTIFACTS` |
| `react.memsearch` | `REACT_LITE_MEMORY_SEARCH_RECOVERY` |
| `react.rg` | `REACT_LITE_LOCAL_ARTIFACT_SEARCH` |
| `react.pull` / `react.checkout` | `REACT_LITE_WORKSPACE_PULL_CHECKOUT` |
| `react.patch` | `REACT_LITE_PATCHING` |
| `react.plan` | `REACT_LITE_PLANNING` |
| exec tool / ISO runtime | `REACT_LITE_EXEC_TOOL` |
| rendering tools | `REACT_LITE_RENDERING_TOOLS` |
| web search/fetch tools | `REACT_LITE_WEB_TOOLS` |
| internal note writes | `REACT_LITE_INTERNAL_NOTES` |
| durable memory read/search | `REACT_LITE_DURABLE_USER_MEMORY_READ` |
| durable memory write/proposal | `REACT_LITE_DURABLE_USER_MEMORY_WRITE` |

Do not include tool-specific blocks for tools that are not exposed. If the
instruction says "use exec" but the tool catalog has no exec tool, lower-cost
models may still try to call it. The lite set should be narrower than the
default body when the agent surface is narrower.

## Audit Method

1. List the bundle's enabled tools from `tools_descriptor.py`, MCP tools, and
   built-in `react.*` tools.
2. Choose the closest lite profile.
3. Add missing blocks for exposed capabilities.
4. Remove blocks for unavailable capabilities.
5. Keep tool and skill catalogs enabled unless the agent truly has no tools or
   skills.
6. Add bundle-specific rules as a short literal block after the generic blocks.
7. Render or log the final system text in a non-production test and check that:
   - the strict protocol is present
   - the instruction body is the expected lite/custom body
   - the tool catalog matches the tools actually enabled
   - the body does not mention unavailable tools
   - no LLM-facing block says "include this block" or otherwise speaks to the
     bundle author instead of the model

For quick local validation:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.skills.instructions.shared_instructions_lite import (
    default_lite_system_instruction,
)

body = default_lite_system_instruction("workspace_exec")
assert "include this block" not in body.lower()
assert "EXEC TOOL" in body
assert "DURABLE USER MEMORY - WRITE" not in body
```

## Choosing Extended Or Lite

Use the extended/default body for broad, production, general-purpose agents
where maximum behavioral coverage matters more than prompt size.

Use lite profiles for demo agents, cost-sensitive agents, narrowly-scoped
bundle agents, or agents where the author wants an explicit capability-by-capability
instruction surface.

Use a fully custom body only when the bundle author owns the complete behavior
contract. A custom body still receives the strict protocol and may still receive
the tool/skill catalogs, but it replaces the default React onboarding text.
