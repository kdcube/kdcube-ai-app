# SDK Cross-Conversation Memory

This module defines the SDK-level user memory store for durable context that
survives across conversations. It is intentionally separate from any one bundle:
bundles expose tools and UI, while the SDK memory layer owns the persistence,
ranking, and concurrency rules.

Code lives in:

```text
kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/context/memory/
```

## Goals

- Store durable user memory in PostgreSQL, not in per-turn scratch files.
- Support tiers: confirmed high-value memories stay hot, lower-confidence
  memories remain searchable.
- Support semantic, keyword, label, recency, update-count, and confirmation
  signals in one search API.
- Allow concurrent conversations for the same user without duplicate storms.
- Let background jobs read memory while keeping writes restricted to approved
  conversational surfaces or service APIs.
- Expose only user-visible memories to canvas or user-facing UI.

## Bundle Configuration

Memory is opt-in per bundle. A full safe development configuration is:

```yaml
config:
  memory:
    enabled: true

    announce:
      enabled: true
      limit: 8
      scope_filter: current_bundle
      timeout_seconds: 1.5

    tools:
      enabled: false
      allow_write: false
      default_scope_filter: current_bundle
      embedding_enabled: true
      embedding_timeout_seconds: 3.0

    widget:
      enabled: true
      allow_write: true
      default_scope_filter: current_bundle
      allow_all_user_memories: true
      ensure_schema: true
      limit: 30
      search_min_relevance_score: 0.58

  ui:
    widgets:
      memories:
        enabled: true
```

`memory.enabled` is the master switch. `announce.enabled` injects a bounded
hotset into ReAct turn preparation. `widget.enabled` exposes the user-facing
memory widget. Keep `tools.allow_write=false` until explicit conversational
memory-write policy is enabled.

Allowed scope filters are:

```text
current_bundle
all_user_memories
global_only
current_bundle_or_global
```

When a bundle inherits `MemoryEntrypointMixin`, the memory widget source folder
and build command are provided by defaults; descriptors usually only need
`ui.widgets.memories.enabled=true`.

## Storage Model

Postgres is authoritative. The platform provisioning scripts install the
tables, and the module uses `pgvector` in version 1. Redis is not part of the
memory correctness path; use it only for optional cross-replica locks around
maintenance jobs.

The store creates three tables in the tenant/project schema:

```text
<schema>.user_memory_entries
<schema>.user_memory_events
<schema>.user_memory_aliases
```

`user_memory_entries` is the current state of each memory.
`user_memory_events` is the append-only evidence trail: confirmations,
refinements, contradictions, edits, retirements, and agent observations.
`user_memory_aliases` stores stable lookup hooks such as labels and keywords.

These names intentionally do not reuse the older `<schema>.user_memory`
`fact/strength/tags` table. That table can continue to exist until we decide on
an explicit migration.

Provisioning is done by:

```text
kdcube_ai_app/ops/deployment/sql/chatbot/deploy-kdcube-proj-schema.sql
kdcube_ai_app/ops/deployment/sql/chatbot/drop-kdcube-proj-schema.sql
```

The caller passes a `MemoryScope`:

```python
MemoryScope(
    tenant="demo-tenant",
    project="demo-project",
    user_id=user_id,
    bundle_id="task-and-memo-app@1-0",
)
```

The store accepts an existing processor `pg_pool`:

```python
store = UserMemoryStore(pg_pool=request.app.state.pg_pool, tenant=tenant, project=project)
await store.ensure_schema()
```

## Writes

Use `record_signal()` for both create and update.

```python
await store.record_signal(
    scope=scope,
    signal=MemorySignal(
        memory="User prefers concise technical answers.",
        context="Repeatedly asked to avoid fluffy explanations.",
        kind="preference",
        event_type="confirmation",
        originator="user",
        labels=["communication-style"],
        keywords=["concise", "technical"],
        confidence=0.9,
        importance=0.8,
        visibility="user",
        source={
            "conversation_id": conversation_id,
            "turn_id": turn_id,
            "bundle_id": scope.bundle_id,
        },
    ),
)
```

The write path:

```text
MemorySignal
   |
   v
normalize labels / keywords / visibility
   |
   v
find row by match_memory_id or canonical_key
   |
   v
optional conservative candidate match
   |
   v
SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
   |
   v
append user_memory_events row
   |
   v
recompute scores, tier, revision
```

Concurrent identical writes converge through the unique canonical key:

```text
(tenant, project, user_id, canonical_key) WHERE merged_into_id IS NULL
```

## Tiers

Tier is computed from confidence, importance, freshness, confirmation rate, and
update count.

```text
Tier 1: active, repeatedly confirmed, high salience
Tier 2: useful but not fully established
Tier 3: weak, new, contradicted, or low-salience
Tier 4: retired or merged
```

Tier is a serving hint, not a permission flag. Lower-tier memories remain
searchable.

## Search Modes

`MemorySearchRequest.mode` supports:

```text
hybrid          semantic + text + labels + salience + recency
recent          most recently updated memories
recent_created  newest memories
recent_events   latest evidence events
important       highest importance/salience
confirmed       strongest confirmation rate/count
hotset          tier/salience order for compact prompt injection
```

Examples:

```python
await store.search(MemorySearchRequest(scope=scope, query="email preferences", mode="hybrid"))
await store.search(MemorySearchRequest(scope=scope, mode="recent", limit=10))
await store.get_hotset(scope=scope, limit=8)
```

For "last N memories", use the explicit helpers:

```python
await store.list_recent_memories(scope=scope, limit=10)
await store.list_recent_memories(scope=scope, limit=10, created=True)
await store.list_recent_events(scope=scope, limit=20)
```

Hybrid search is a two-branch recall plus scoring pipeline:

```text
query text + optional query embedding
  |
  +-- lexical branch:
  |     normalized meaningful query terms
  |     PostgreSQL text search over memory/context/labels/keywords
  |
  +-- semantic branch:
        pgvector cosine similarity over memory embeddings
  |
  v
union + de-duplicate candidates
  |
  v
rank_candidate()
  semantic + lexical text + label/keyword match
  + salience + importance + confidence + freshness + confirmation
```

The lexical branch intentionally drops filler words such as `which`, `i`,
`the`, and `where`, so a query like `cities which i visit` searches on
meaningful terms such as `cities` and `visit`.

If query embeddings are unavailable, search falls back to lexical recall plus
quality ranking. Quality ranking still uses tier, pinned status, confidence,
salience, importance, freshness, and updated time as sort signals. If a memory
has no embedding, it can still match through text, labels, and keywords.

`search_min_relevance_score` prevents unrelated memories from being returned
just because the database is small. Keep the default conservative in widgets,
then tune per product once real usage data is available.

## Labels And Keywords

Use both.

Labels are stable facets used for filtering and UI chips:

```text
communication-style, delivery-channel, product-scope
```

Keywords are looser retrieval hooks and aliases:

```text
telegram, brief, invoice, crm, wuppertal
```

Search supports both labels and keywords, and also full text over memory,
context, labels, and keywords.

## Visibility

Visibility controls UI exposure:

```text
user / owner / public  -> visible_to_user=true
private / internal     -> visible_to_user=false
```

Canvas and user-facing memory widgets should request only visible rows:

```python
MemorySearchRequest(scope=scope, mode="important", visible_to_user=True)
```

Private/internal rows may still be available to the assistant when the bundle
policy allows it.

User edits should become events, not silent overwrites. A canvas edit can call
`record_signal(event_type="user_edit", match_memory_id=...)`; a user
confirmation can call `confirm_memory(...)`; a delete/hide action should
normally call `retire_memory(...)` so the evidence trail remains available.

The service/API layer can live in a bundle base entrypoint: widgets and API
endpoints call this SDK store with the authenticated user scope and the
processor `pg_pool`. The memory store is intentionally not a REST service by
itself.

## Background Jobs

Background jobs should normally receive read-only tools:

```text
search, recent, hotset: allowed
record_signal, update_status, retire: not allowed
```

This prevents unattended jobs from reshaping long-term user memory. If a job
discovers a durable signal, it should return evidence to the conversational
surface or a service-owned reconciliation endpoint.

## Reusable Tools

The SDK ships a reusable Semantic Kernel-compatible tool module:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.context.memory import make_user_memory_tools

memory_tools = make_user_memory_tools(
    scope_provider=current_bundle_scope,
    store_factory=lambda sc: UserMemoryStore(
        pg_pool=sc["pg_pool"],
        tenant=sc["tenant"],
        project=sc["project"],
    ),
    allow_write=True,
)
```

For job agents:

```python
job_memory_tools = make_user_memory_tools(
    scope_provider=current_job_scope,
    store_factory=store_factory,
    allow_write=False,
)
```

Provided functions:

```text
search_memory
recent_memories
record_memory
confirm_memory
retire_memory
```

## Announce Hotset

The ReAct announce should not dump the full memory database. Use a compact
hotset:

```python
hot = await store.get_hotset(scope=scope, limit=8)
```

Good announce shape:

```text
[USER MEMORY HOTSET]
  - me:mem_abc tier=1 conf=0.91 updated=2026-05-10 labels=style
    User prefers concise technical answers.
  - me:mem_def tier=1 conf=0.86 updated=2026-05-08 labels=delivery
    User prefers Telegram for short reports.
```

The hotset should include only high-salience active memories and must stay
small. Do not include event history, long context, source JSON, full score
breakdowns, or conversation provenance in the announce.

## Agent-Facing Render Contract

Memory signals shown to a loop agent must be sharp and compact. The agent needs
enough information to improve the answer and decide whether to create a new
memory, confirm an existing memory, or refine an existing memory. It should not
receive the full event trail by default.

Default search results and default `me:<memory_id>` reads should expose:

```text
id
memory
context, short/capped for search and full current context for explicit me:<id>
kind
visibility
status
labels
keywords
tier
confidence_score
importance_score
salience_score
confirmation_count
contradiction_count
updated_at
last_confirmed_at
revision
```

The announce hotset is smaller than search results. It should usually show only
`id`, `memory`, `tier`, a compact confidence/salience signal, labels, and an
updated timestamp.

Search results may include short context and count details so the agent can
choose between update and create:

```text
me:mem_abc
memory: User prefers concise technical answers.
context: Especially for engineering/debugging tasks.
labels: style, engineering
keywords: concise, technical
status: active visibility: user tier: 1
confidence: 0.91 importance: 0.72 salience: 0.88
confirmations: 4 contradictions: 0
updated: 2026-05-10 last_confirmed: 2026-05-10 revision: 5
```

Evidence events are lazy. They must not be included in default search results,
hotsets, or default `me:<id>` renders. Expose them only through an explicit
evidence view, for example:

```text
me:mem_abc?view=evidence
memory.get_evidence(id="mem_abc", limit=5)
```

The agent should request evidence only when provenance or conflict resolution is
actually needed: explaining why a memory exists, deciding between near
duplicates, resolving contradictions, retiring a memory, or materially rewriting
an important memory.

Recommended update flow for ReAct-style agents:

```text
1. Search existing memories by semantic/text/labels/keywords.
2. If a close memory exists:
     - confirm_memory(id) when the new signal simply reinforces it
     - record_memory(match_memory_id=id, event_type=refinement/user_edit/agent_observation)
       when the current memory should change
3. If no close memory exists, create a new memory.
4. Read evidence only for destructive, conflicting, or provenance-sensitive changes.
```

## Reconciliation

The normal write path is incremental. Reconciliation is a separate maintenance
operation for duplicate cleanup and semantic merges:

```text
candidate duplicates -> review/merge -> merged_into_id -> event trail retained
```

Do not run broad reconciliation inside every chat turn.

A good first scheduling model is similar to compaction: the turn may opportunely
request reconciliation, but a cross-replica lock ensures that only one worker
runs it for a user/bundle window. The job should be bounded and skip quickly if
another worker already owns the lease.

The reconciler agent and application design are documented in
[user-memories-reconcilation-README.md](user-memories-reconcilation-README.md).
