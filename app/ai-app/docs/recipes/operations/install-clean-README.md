# Install KDCube: Clean Bootstrap

One init on a fresh machine produces a working ecosystem, ready to change
afterwards. This recipe is the zero-input path; when you have a descriptor
set from an existing environment (the CI/CD path), use
[Install From Descriptors](install-from-descriptors-README.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

- Docker running (`docker version`), ~20 GB free disk (`df -h $HOME`)
- Python 3.11+ (`python3 --version`), `git`
- A Google **Web application** OAuth client id — the one input the default
  login needs (see [Init](#init)). It is public, and this flow has no client
  secret.
- Only for the optional Telegram companion: a bot token from **@BotFather** and
  a public HTTPS URL that reaches this machine.
- The first `--build` is slow (node, playwright/chromium, pip image layers);
  later refreshes are cached and fast.

## Install the CLI

```shell
export REPO="$HOME/src/kdcube-ai-app"          # your platform checkout
git clone https://github.com/kdcube/kdcube.git "$REPO" 2>/dev/null || true
export CLI_VENV="$REPO/app/venvs/ai-app/kdcube-cli"
export KDCUBE="$CLI_VENV/bin/kdcube"

python3 -m venv "$CLI_VENV"
"$CLI_VENV/bin/pip" install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
"$CLI_VENV/bin/pip" install -e "$REPO/app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_cli"
"$KDCUBE" --help
```

Reinstall only when the CLI source itself changed — not for ordinary
platform pulls.

## Init

The default identity is **application-hosted login** (`--auth-type bundle`):
the workspace app hosts the Google sign-in page and Connection Hub issues the
KDCube session, so you need no external IdP. Its one input is a Google **Web
application** OAuth client id — public, no client secret, because the browser's
ID token is verified against Google's JWKS.

Create that OAuth client first and authorize, as **JavaScript origins**, every
origin the browser loads the platform from: the local UI origin and any public
URL you use. One client holds both.

> The proxy publishes `ports.proxy_http`, falling back to `ports.ui`, then to
> `80`. Staged defaults set `ports.ui` to **`5174`** and leave `ports.proxy_http`
> unset, so the local UI origin is `http://localhost:5174`.

Copy the client id (`…apps.googleusercontent.com`).

```shell
export TENANT="acme"
export PROJECT="main"

# Optional: substituted into <PUBLIC_HOST> / <ADMIN_EMAIL> placeholder slots in
# the staged default descriptors — unrelated to the auth flags below.
export KDCUBE_PUBLIC_HOST="kdcube.example.com"
export KDCUBE_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com"

"$KDCUBE" init --path "$REPO" --tenant "$TENANT" --project "$PROJECT" --build \
  --auth-type bundle \
  --client-id "<google-web-oauth-client-id>" \
  --bootstrap-admin-email "admin@example.com" \
  --set-secret services.openai.api_key "$OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  --set-secret services.anthropic.api_key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

`--bootstrap-admin-email` is the verified Google email granted `super-admin` on
first login; omit it and no bootstrap admin rule is written. `--provider`
defaults to `google`, the only supported bundle provider. All three bundle flags
require `--auth-type bundle`.

Secrets are never typed inline: export them and let the shell expand the
reference, as with `"$OPENAI_API_KEY"` above.

The other methods (`cognito`, `simple`, `delegated`), their per-mode flags, and
reconfiguring auth on a live runtime with `kdcube config apply` live in
[CLI §2.3e Authentication](../../service/cicd/cli-README.md#auth-flags), the
canonical flag reference.

`init` is first-time creation ONLY: it refuses an already-initialized
workdir. `init --build` builds images and stops — nothing runs until
`kdcube start`.

### Optional: the Telegram companion

A Telegram bot needs a public HTTPS URL Telegram can reach for the webhook and
Mini App. Any tunnel works — ngrok, cloudflared, or your own domain; point it at
the proxy UI port above and prefer a stable URL over a random per-run one.

The bot token has no flag by design — it is a secret, so the CLI reads it from
the environment:

```shell
export KDCUBE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<token-from-@BotFather>"

"$KDCUBE" init ... \
  --enable-telegram --external-https-url "https://<your-public-host>"
```

Authorize that same public URL as a JavaScript origin on the OAuth client. Init
appends its origin to `cors.allow_origins` for you — the Mini App's cross-origin
WebSocket needs it.

### What the init stages

The base complectation, already configured (a pure config overlay — the
apps ship in the image and auto-discover):

```text
connection-hub@1-0          identity, consent, delegated credentials, OAuth
kdcube-services@1-0         managed MCP surfaces + named-services bridge
user-memories@2026-06-26    the mem provider + memories widget
workspace@2026-03-31-13-36  showcase scene + chat wired to everything
```

Default identity is the bundle-session flavor: Google sign-in validated by
the workspace app, KDCube session issued by Connection Hub — no external
IdP. `--bootstrap-admin-email` is the super-admin bootstrap rule in the
Connection Hub authority registry.

### The first-run checklist

Init ends by printing the placeholders still unfilled (`<FILL_ME>` secret
slots; `<PUBLIC_HOST>` / `<ADMIN_EMAIL>` when their env vars were unset).
Features backed by an unfilled slot stay inactive; everything else runs.
Fill slots later in `$WORKDIR/config/bundles.yaml` /
`bundles.secrets.yaml` — every slot carries a comment saying what it is and
where to get it — or via the AI Bundles dashboard.

## Start and verify

```shell
export WORKDIR="$HOME/.kdcube/kdcube-runtime/${TENANT}__${PROJECT}"
"$KDCUBE" defaults --default-tenant "$TENANT" --default-project "$PROJECT" --default-workdir "$WORKDIR"
"$KDCUBE" start
```

`start` creates and starts the containers, runs the one-shot postgres-setup
schema bootstrap, and preloads bundles (materializing git-backed ones and
building widget UIs). First start takes a minute or two.

Verify in three layers — `kdcube info` is necessary but NOT sufficient (it
reports process/mount state, not per-bundle build outcomes):

```shell
"$KDCUBE" info

# 1) the UI actually answers — the real done-signal (port = ports.ui, 5174 by default):
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "chat UI -> HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:5174/platform/chat  # want 200

# 2) staged descriptors are the runtime authority:
ls "$WORKDIR/config/"

# 3) per-bundle build outcomes live in the proc logs:
PROC="$(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep chat-proc | head -1)"
docker logs --since 10m "$PROC" 2>&1 | grep -iE "bundle.ui|widget:.*build (done|failed)|preload|ERROR|Traceback" | tail -40
```

You want to SEE `widget:... build done` per UI bundle and NOT see
`build failed` / `Traceback`.
