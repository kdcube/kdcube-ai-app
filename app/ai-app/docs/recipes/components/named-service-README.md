# Recipe: Named-Service App

A named-service app makes a domain realm usable by generic agents and UI
surfaces. It lets unfamiliar apps interoperate through object refs such as
`mem:record:...`, `task:issue:...`, `conv:fi:...`, and `cnv:...` without copying the
realm's storage or action rules.

This is not the only way apps interact in KDCube. Apps can also expose API/MCP,
Event Bus, Data Bus, cron/jobs, or UI surfaces. Use named services when the
realm needs generic agent exploration/exploitation (including ReAct), Pinboard
pins, Chat context, Scene open actions, and provenance.

## Runtime Shape

```text
provider app
  explicitly publishes namespace: task
  implements operations
    object.search
    object.get
    object.action
    block.produce
    block.render
  emits events
    task-scoped updates
    accounting.usage
    UI events for target surfaces

consumer app
  holds object_ref only
  calls named-service operation
  receives normalized response
  renders through shared contracts
```

## Publish Only From The Owner

Defining a provider class is not enough to publish it. The owner app contributes
the provider instance through `_named_service_providers()`; the base entrypoint
assembles and publishes the complete registry.

```python
def _named_service_providers(self) -> list:
    return [
        *super()._named_service_providers(),
        self._task_provider(),
    ]
```

Do not contribute the provider from composition apps that merely use the
realm, and do not make reusable mixins publish by inheritance. The current app
registry is reconciled on load, so removing a contribution withdraws that
app's old discovery record. Keep the lifecycle details in
[Discovery Registry](../../sdk/namespace-services/discovery-README.md);
consumer configuration stays in
[Namespace Service Clients](../../sdk/namespace-services/clients-README.md).

## The Human Layer (Required Authoring Step)

A realm ships with TWO readers: the agent (reads `about`/`object_schema` and
works the grammar) and the user (reads the capability picker's service card
and narrows the realm per operation/action). The card renders declared text
only, so authoring includes the presentation:

```text
spec.metadata
  presentation.about          purpose sentence in user terms
  presentation.works_with     internal realm: what it operates on
    (or presentation.third_party for a provider-backed realm)
  presentation.operations     {op: {label, description}} in user terms
  presentation.actions        {action: {label, description}}
  object_kinds                {kind: one-liner}
```

Declare this metadata on BOTH spec declarations when the provider has two —
the instance-spec helper and the `@named_service_provider(...)` registration;
one place only leaves raw grammar tokens on the card (see
[Providers — The Presentation Layer](../../sdk/namespace-services/providers-README.md)).

Provider-backed realms (acting through a user's external account) also
declare `metadata.connected_accounts` — provider/connector ids, claims,
`claims_by_operation` where the realm truly differentiates, and human
`claim_labels`. Field-by-field reference:
[Providers — The Presentation Layer](../../sdk/namespace-services/providers-README.md);
what users see and control:
[Per-User Agent Capabilities](../../sdk/solutions/user-settings/capabilities-README.md);
consent semantics (demand-driven at the attempt, scoped claims, deep links):
[Delegated Accounts](../../sdk/solutions/connections/delegated-accounts/delegated-accounts-README.md).

## Object Actions

Scene open routing uses provider-backed actions:

```text
user drops task:issue:123 onto task area
  scene calls object.action(open, object_ref)
  provider returns:
    ui_event.target_surface = task_tracker.issue_editor
    ui_event.payload = object/open data
  scene matches target_surface to a configured command contract
  scene posts command to the target widget
```

The scene does not decide what a task, memory, or file means. The provider decides the default open effect and target surface.

## Read And Render Pipeline

```text
react.pull(object_ref)
  named-service object.get
  materializes bytes or structured object
  preserves meta.object_ref

react.read(materialized_path)
  block.produce for namespace if declared
  output blocks retain meta.object_ref

timeline projection
  group blocks by meta.object_ref namespace
  call block.render for declared render policies
  provider may patch/replace owned blocks within limits
```

`block.render` is optional. When declared, it gives the namespace provider a late rendering hook for model-facing or UI-facing projection.

## Events

Named-service providers should emit events with enough identity for consumers:

```json
{
  "type": "task.issue.changed",
  "metadata": {
    "object_ref": "task:issue:123",
    "agent_id": "agent-or-surface-id"
  }
}
```

Today some widget-local event names still exist. The direction is namespace-owned event names and object URIs.

## Agent Access Is Granted Per Agent

A realm's agent consumers — external MCP clients and agents hosted in KDCube
apps alike — enter under the user's delegated-by grant for that specific agent
(`kdcube-agent:<app>:<agent>`), checked at the tool attempt when the
deployment's delegated catalog publishes the namespace; a missing grant raises
a one-click consent demand in chat. The check is per operation and stays live
after a first grant: an operation whose grants the agent's record lacks denies
with exactly the missing ones, which rise as the same demand — the approval
merges into the record. Provider-backed realms keep the connected-account
consent as a second, per-call-checked layer. The realm implements neither
check — both ride the platform boundary. Model:
[Agents Acting On Behalf Of The User](../../sdk/solutions/connections/agent-acting-for-user/agent-acting-for-user-README.md).

## Current Gaps

- Data Bus subjects and Event Bus event names should converge on URI-like naming.
