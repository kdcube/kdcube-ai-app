# Recipe: Chat Widget

The chat widget is an app widget that hosts a ReAct conversation and participates in the scene as a context producer and context consumer. It should not know memory, task, or canvas internals.

Read [Architecture Of What You Build](../../arch/architecture-of-what-you-build-README.md)
first for the app/service-provider map. This recipe covers only the Chat/ReAct
surface. Declaring the AGENT behind the chat (per-agent config, tools/skills
inventory, `supported_models`, the user-facing composer menu) is the
[Chat With A ReAct Agent recipe](./chat-with-react-agent-README.md).

## Runtime Shape

```text
chat iframe
  UI shell
    timeline
    steps
    artifacts/files/context chips
  event client
    conversation stream for this chat
    optional scene subscription messages
  context adapter
    drag context out
    attach context in
  ReAct backend
    tools
    artifacts
    named-service object pull/read
    accounting events
```

## Serve It From Your App

Four wiring points put this widget on your own app, backed by your own agent:

1. Register the widget on the entrypoint — an `@ui_widget(alias="my_chat", ...)`
   method (its body is a served-from-build placeholder), plus a
   `visibility.widget.my_chat` block in the descriptor for who may load it.
2. Declare the UI source: `config.ui.widgets.my_chat: chat_widget_ui_config()`
   from the entrypoint, or inline YAML with
   `src_folder: sdk://solutions/chat/ui/widget` and an `engine` selector.
   `engine` picks the implementation: `local` (in-tree engine + UI, no
   `npm://`), `package` (package engine, in-tree UI), `package-ui` (package
   engine + packaged `<Chat/>` UI; materializes `@kdcube/components-*` via
   `npm://` shared sources). Helper reference:
   [Chat Widget Solution](../../sdk/solutions/chat/chat-widget-solution-README.md);
   build mechanics:
   [Widget Integration](../../sdk/npm/widget-integration-README.md).
3. Bind the agent. The widget talks to the app it is served from; the agent
   key (`agentId`, default `main`) selects which of the app's declared agents
   answers. Declaring that agent — inventory, react block,
   `supported_models`, per-user customization — is the
   [Chat With A ReAct Agent recipe](./chat-with-react-agent-README.md).
4. Declare the chat surface: `surfaces.as_provider.bundle.default_chat: true`
   in the descriptor makes the control plane draw the conversation UI for the
   app (absent means the app presents its widget scene instead). Auth rides
   the standard widget path: the iframe resolves tokens from the served route
   and the parent CONFIG handshake, and signed-in users get the composer "+"
   menu.

To mount the widget inside a composed scene instead of serving it standalone,
declare it as a scene component: [Scene recipe](./scene-README.md).

## Scene Boundary

When embedded, the scene provides:

- runtime origin, tenant, project, and app id;
- namespace presentation config;
- context attach commands;
- scene-delivered events only when configured for that widget.

When standalone, the chat widget uses its runtime URL/config and owns its direct streams.

## Context Drag And Attach

```text
chat context chip drag
  -> kdcube-context-drag-start
     contexts: [{ ref: "mem:record:..." }]

drop on canvas
  -> scene command: kdcube.surface.command target_surface=sdk.canvas.pinboard action=pin

drop on owning widget
  -> scene object.action(open)
  -> provider ui_event.target_surface
  -> scene command: kdcube.surface.command action=open

drop from canvas/memory/task onto chat
  -> scene command: kdcube.surface.command target_surface=sdk.chat.context action=attach
  -> chat adds canonical context chip
```

The attached context keeps its original object URI. Color and label come from namespace presentation config and object metadata, not from chat-specific fallbacks.

## Event Handling

Chat has two different event concerns:

- Conversation events: tool calls, tool results, assistant/user output, and chat-local accounting display.
- Scene events: events that the host fans out to widgets that registered subscriptions.

For cross-widget accounting refresh, the usage widget is the consumer. Chat may still render accounting for the active chat turn when the event belongs to that chat instance.

## Config

A scene should declare chat as a context drop target:

```json
{
  "contextDropTargets": {
    "workspace": {
      "surfaceRef": "website.chat",
      "accepts": "context",
      "dropEffect": "attach",
      "targetSurface": "sdk.chat.context",
      "action": "attach"
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Gaps

- Context chip and drag helpers now live in shared component packages; remaining
  chat-specific wiring should stay thin and host-driven.
- Chat-local filtering for accounting events should use stable agent/session identity metadata as multi-agent flows expand.
