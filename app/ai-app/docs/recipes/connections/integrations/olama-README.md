# Ollama Integration (Locally Served Models)

Serve a model running on your own machine — via Ollama — as a selectable
brain for KDCube agents: the react agent's decision head, JSON-producing
agent heads, and content-generation tools all stream from it through the
platform's normal model-service path.

The integration is deliberately additive. No platform module changes: the
platform's existing `provider: custom` role path talks to a small standalone
**models gateway** that translates to Ollama. Every piece is either new
(`apps/models_gateway/`), app-owned (entrypoint props hook), or descriptor
configuration.

```text
agent role / composer pick {provider: custom}
  ModelRouter._mk_custom → CustomModelClient          platform (unchanged)
    POST {endpoint}/generate  {"inputs","parameters"}   custom protocol
      models gateway (host, :11500)                    apps/models_gateway
        POST :11434/api/chat  {"model","messages",...}  Ollama
```

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Ollama** on the host that runs the local KDCube install.
  - macOS: the Ollama app (menu-bar; starts the server on `:11434`,
    auto-starts at login, self-updates). macOS 14+.
  - Any OS: `ollama serve` for a foreground/headless server.
  - Verify: `curl -s localhost:11434/api/version`.
- **A model that fits the machine.** Guidance for a 36–48 GB Apple Silicon
  workstation:

  | Model | Shape | Size | Why |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `qwen3.6:35b` | MoE, ~3B active/token | 24 GB | fast interactive brain; 256K ctx; vision + tools |
  | `qwen3.6:27b` | dense | 17 GB | highest local coding quality; slower tokens/s |
  | `qwen3:0.6b` | tiny | 0.5 GB | pipeline smoke tests only |

  ```bash
  ollama pull qwen3.6:35b
  ```

- **The models gateway**, run on the host (containers reach it via
  `host.docker.internal`):

  ```bash
  cd app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app
  GATEWAY_MODEL=qwen3.6:35b \
    python3 -m uvicorn kdcube_ai_app.apps.models_gateway.app:app --port 11500
  ```

## 2. How the connector is implemented

### 2.1 The platform side: `provider: custom`

`ModelRouter` (`infra/service_hub/inventory.py`) resolves each role's
`{provider, model}`; `provider: custom` constructs a `CustomModelClient`
bound to the configured endpoint. That client speaks a small HTTP protocol:

- request — `POST {endpoint}` with

  ```json
  {"inputs": [{"role": "system|user|assistant", "content": "... or blocks"}],
   "parameters": {"max_new_tokens": 1024, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9,
                   "stream": true}}
  ```

  plus optional `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. The client does NOT transmit
  a model name — the serving side owns model selection.
- non-stream response — `{"response": text, "usage": {...}, "id": ...}`;
- stream — SSE `data: {"delta": "..."}` per chunk, one final event
  `data: {"final": true, "usage": {...}}`, then `data: [DONE]`.

### 2.2 The gateway: protocol translation

`kdcube_ai_app/apps/models_gateway/app.py` (~250 lines, FastAPI) accepts
that protocol on `/generate` and forwards to Ollama `/api/chat`:

| Custom protocol | Ollama |
| --- | --- |
| `inputs[].role/content` | `messages[].role/content` (+ `images`, §5) |
| `parameters.max_new_tokens` | `options.num_predict` |
| `parameters.temperature` / `top_p` | `options.temperature` / `top_p` |
| `parameters.stream` | `stream` |
| — (gateway env `GATEWAY_MODEL`) | `model` |
| — (gateway env `GATEWAY_KEEP_ALIVE`, default 30m) | `keep_alive` |
| — (gateway env `GATEWAY_THINK`, default off) | `think` (§4) |

Coming back, Ollama's JSONL chunks (`{"message":{"content": piece}}`) become
SSE `{"delta": piece}` events, and the terminal chunk's
`prompt_eval_count`/`eval_count` become
`usage.{prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens}` on the final event.
Legacy parameters from the historical models-hub protocol (`min_p`,
`skip_cot`, `fabrication_awareness`, `prompt_mode`) are accepted and
ignored.

One gateway instance serves one model. A second model = a second gateway on
another port, referenced by a second app's descriptor (or a different
deployment profile).

Optional auth: set `GATEWAY_API_KEY` on the gateway and put the same value
in the app's secrets (`services.llm.custom.api_key`, §6).

## 3. How the platform streams from it

`ModelServiceBase.stream_model_text` (and `stream_model_text_tracked`, which
adds accounting and thought-group handling) dispatches per client type. For
`CustomModelClient` it consumes `client.astream(...)` directly; the chunk
contract at that seam is:

```text
{"delta": str}                                    zero or more
{"event": "final", "usage": {...}, "model_name"}  exactly once
```

The final usage is normalized into the platform accounting shape
(`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, cache fields zeroed), so economics rows
appear for `provider=custom` like for any hosted provider — with the token
counts Ollama actually measured.

Everything that rides `stream_model_text_tracked` therefore works with the
local model with no additional wiring:

- the react v3 decision head (channeled workspace streamer) — the local
  model's deltas drive the same channel protocol as hosted models;
- JSON-producing agent heads (the composite JSON artifact streamers);
- content tools (`generate_content_llm`-style backends).

Structured output: custom clients have no server-side JSON mode; agents rely
on prompt-driven JSON plus the platform's format-fixer pass. In practice
strong local models follow the channel/JSON conventions; watch the
format-fixer engagement rate when evaluating a model.

## 4. Thinking models

Qwen3-family (and other hybrid reasoners) emit their reasoning into a
separate `thinking` field in Ollama's response — NOT into content. Two
consequences:

- with thinking enabled, a short `max_new_tokens` can be consumed entirely
  by thought, returning a syntactically valid but EMPTY completion — no
  error anywhere, the platform just sees an empty answer;
- the platform's custom protocol carries a single delta channel, and the
  platform's channel streamers drive their own output structure through
  prompts — interleaved model-native thinking would corrupt that framing.

The gateway therefore requests `think: false` by default. `GATEWAY_THINK=1`
re-enables model-native thinking for raw experiments (thinking text is
dropped, never streamed). If a future wave wants visible local-model
thinking, the seam is the gateway: map Ollama's `thinking` chunks onto the
platform's thinking-delta events — a gateway + streaming-contract decision,
not an Ollama limitation.

## 5. Multimodal input

Qwen3.6 has vision, and the chain supports it end to end. Image blocks
produced by the platform's modal message helpers pass through
`CustomModelClient` untouched; the gateway splits each message's content
into text plus base64 images and forwards Ollama's per-message `images`:

- Anthropic shape: `{"type": "image", "source": {"type": "base64",
  "media_type": ..., "data": ...}}`
- OpenAI shape: `{"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url":
  "data:image/png;base64,..."}}`

Verified: image + "what single color dominates?" answers correctly, with
image tokens counted in `prompt_tokens`.

Constraint worth knowing: Qwen3-VL's image processor requires ≥32px per
side; Ollama (observed on 0.24) panics its model runner on smaller images
instead of rejecting them. Real attachments never hit this; synthetic
test pixels can.

## 6. Descriptor wiring (no env vars)

All configuration is descriptor-driven. Two blocks in the app's entry in the
runtime `bundles.yaml` (workspace app shown; any app with agents can carry
the same):

```yaml
config:
  # 1) where provider "custom" routes — applied by the app onto its Config
  services:
    llm:
      custom:
        endpoint: http://host.docker.internal:11500/generate
        model_name: qwen3.6:35b        # display/accounting label
  # 2) offer it as a per-conversation composer pick (overrides role_models
  #    for the picking user only — nobody's defaults change)
  react:
    default_agent:
      supported_models:
        - model: qwen3.6:35b
          provider: custom
          label: Qwen3.6 35B (local)
```

Secret (only when the gateway sets `GATEWAY_API_KEY`) — in
`bundles.secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
secrets:
  services:
    llm:
      custom:
        api_key: replace-in-real-deployment
```

The app applies these props onto its per-instance `Config` in its
entrypoint — the pattern any app can copy (the workspace app ships it as
`_apply_custom_llm_props()`):

```python
def _apply_custom_llm_props(self) -> None:
    custom = self.bundle_prop("services.llm.custom", {}) or {}
    endpoint = str(custom.get("endpoint") or "").strip()
    if not endpoint:
        return
    self.config.custom_model_endpoint = endpoint
    self.config.custom_model_name = str(custom.get("model_name") or "custom-model")
    if custom.get("api_key"):
        self.config.custom_model_api_key = str(custom["api_key"])
    self.config.use_custom_endpoint = True
```

Why this seam: apps are rebuilt per reactive event, and the model router
reads `config.custom_model_endpoint` lazily at client creation — so a
per-instance apply in `__init__` is exactly aligned with the platform's
no-local-cache serving model. Alternative to the composer pick: pin a role —
`role_models: {<role>: {provider: custom, model: qwen3.6:35b}}`.

Activation: reload the app (kdcube CLI bundle reload), like any descriptor
config change.

## 7. Verify

```text
1. curl -s localhost:11434/api/version         Ollama up
2. curl -s localhost:11500/health              gateway up; serving model named
3. curl -sN localhost:11500/generate \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
       "inputs": [{"role":"user","content":"Say hi in one word."}],
       "parameters": {"stream": true, "max_new_tokens": 32}}'
                                               deltas, final usage, [DONE]
4. chat composer → pick the local model →      react turn streams; economics
   ask a coding question                       rows appear for provider=custom
```

## 8. Current limits (recorded, not hidden)

- The custom client does not transmit a model name; the gateway's
  `GATEWAY_MODEL` is the source of truth. Keep `model_name` and the composer
  label aligned with it when switching models.
- One model per gateway instance.
- Text + image input; no local embeddings through this path yet (the
  platform's custom-embeddings support is a separate seam).
- Structured output is prompt-driven (no server-side JSON schema mode).
- Prompt caching does not apply; cache token fields are always zero for
  `provider=custom` accounting rows.
