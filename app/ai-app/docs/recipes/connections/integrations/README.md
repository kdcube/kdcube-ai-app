# Integration Recipes

These recipes cover the **delegated to KDCube** direction: a signed-in KDCube
user connects an external provider account, and KDCube tools or named services
later use that provider credential on the user's behalf.

```text
external account credential -> Connection Hub -> KDCube tool/named service
```

## Recipes

| Recipe | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| [Custom OAuth/OIDC Service Integration](custom-oauth-oidc-service-README.md) | A service such as S1 exposes OAuth/OIDC, and KDCube tools need that user's S1 token. |
| [Google Gmail Integration](google-gmail-README.md) | Users should connect Gmail, and KDCube tools should search, read, send, forward, or download attachments through Gmail. |
| [Slack Integration](slack-README.md) | Users should connect Slack workspaces, and KDCube tools should search, list channels, read history, read/write files, or post messages. |
| [Mail Named Service Over MCP](mail-named-service-README.md) | Connected mail accounts should be exposed to external agents as a provider-neutral `mail` namespace. |
| [Telegram Integration](telegram-README.md) | Telegram users should connect a channel identity to a KDCube platform user. |

## Serving Integrations

Connections in the other direction — external serving capacity plugged into
the platform rather than a user account delegated to it:

| --- | --- |
| [Ollama Integration (Locally Served Models)](olama-README.md) | A locally hosted model (Ollama) should serve as a selectable brain for platform agents — streaming, accounting, thinking handling, multimodal input, descriptor wiring. |
