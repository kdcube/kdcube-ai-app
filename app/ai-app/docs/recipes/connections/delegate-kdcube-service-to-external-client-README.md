# Delegate A KDCube Service To An External Client

Use this recipe to understand the user journey when a person connects an
external client, such as Claude, to a KDCube service.

Example:

```text
Connect Claude to KDCube memories.
Claude may search/read memories.
Claude may not receive the user's full KDCube session.
Claude may not call tools that were not consented.
```

## User Journey

```text
1. User opens external client settings
   Example: Claude -> Connectors -> Add local/remote MCP connector

2. User enters a KDCube MCP service URL
   Example:
   https://runtime.example/api/integrations/bundles/demo/demo/
     user-memories@2026-06-26/public/mcp/memories

3. External client probes the service
   KDCube replies that the service requires delegated credentials.

4. External client opens the KDCube consent URL
   User signs in to KDCube if needed.

5. Connection Hub shows consent for this concrete service
   Service: KDCube memories
   Grants: memories:read
   Tools:
     - memory_search
     - memory_get
   Identity scope:
     - grantor only, or
     - grantor identity family

6. User approves selected grants/tools

7. Connection Hub returns an OAuth code to the external client

8. External client exchanges the code for a delegated credential

9. External client calls the KDCube service with:
   Authorization: Bearer <delegated credential>

10. KDCube enforces:
    selected resource
    selected tools
    selected grants
    selected identity scope
```

## What Identity Does The Client Get?

The external client gets its own delegated identity:

```text
authority_id = delegated_client
subject      = integration:claude:<grantor>
```

It does not become the platform browser session.

The delegated credential carries a server-side delegation record:

```text
delegate:
  integration:claude:<grantor>

grantor:
  platform user 02e53484-...

allowed:
  resource = user-memories MCP
  grants   = memories:read
  tools    = memory_search, memory_get
  identity_scope = grantor_identity_family
```

When the target service needs product data owned by connected identities, it
asks Connection Hub to resolve that delegated identity scope. For memories, that
can yield:

```text
memory_user_ids:
  02e53484-...
  telegram_434804821
```

Only descriptor and consent allow this. The external client does not choose
extra user ids.

## Consent Rules

Connection Hub should show only grants that the signed-in KDCube user may
delegate.

```text
descriptor says:
  memories:read can be delegated by registered, paid, privileged, super-admin

signed-in user has:
  kdcube:role:registered

consent can show:
  memories:read

consent must not show:
  grants that require roles/permissions this user does not have
```

Tool selection is narrower than grant selection:

```text
grant:
  memories:read

tools under that grant:
  memory_search
  memory_get

user selects:
  memory_search only

result:
  token cannot call memory_get
```

## Identity Scope Choices

Services can define the identity scope they support.

```text
grantor
  The external client can see only records owned by the consenting platform user.

grantor_identity_family
  The external client can see records owned by the consenting user's connected
  identities, if the relevant connection edges grant identity:family.
```

For user memories, `grantor_identity_family` is usually the useful scope:

```text
platform memory notes
telegram memory notes
future linked-channel memory notes
```

## End-To-End Diagram

```text
External client
  "I want to use this MCP resource"
        |
        v
KDCube MCP resource
  "Protected. Use Connection Hub OAuth metadata."
        |
        v
Connection Hub OAuth adapter
  browser sign-in + consent
        |
        v
Connection Hub grant store
  access token -> delegated_client credential
  selected resource/tools/grants
  delegation edge to grantor
        |
        v
External client
  calls MCP with Bearer token
        |
        v
Managed surface guard
  verifies token, resource, tool, grant
        |
        v
Product service
  optionally resolves delegated identity scope
        |
        v
Result
```

## What The User Should See

A good consent screen should be concrete:

```text
Connect Claude to KDCube memories

Claude will be allowed to:
  [x] Search memory notes
  [x] Read one memory note

Memory scope:
  [x] Include my connected identities

Claude will not be allowed to:
  - edit memories
  - delete memories
  - access unrelated KDCube services
```

Avoid generic text like "approve OAuth access". The user needs to understand the
service, tools, and identity scope.

## Minimal Test

```text
1. Configure a managed memories MCP resource.
2. Add it as a connector in the external client.
3. Complete KDCube sign-in and consent.
4. In the external client, list tools.
5. Confirm only consented tools are available/usable.
6. Ask the external client to search memories.
7. Confirm it sees only the consented identity scope.
8. Revoke or narrow the grant, then confirm calls fail closed.
```

## What Not To Do

- Do not give the external client the user's browser cookie.
- Do not issue admin/super-admin authority just because the grantor is admin.
- Do not let the client select arbitrary grants or tools.
- Do not bypass Connection Hub identity-scope resolution in product services.
- Do not describe this as "MCP auth"; it is delegated credentials for a
  protected resource, and MCP is only the first resource family.
