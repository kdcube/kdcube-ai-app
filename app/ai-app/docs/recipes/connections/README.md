# Connection Recipes

These recipes are practical entry points for building with Connection Hub. They
are intentionally shorter and more task-oriented than the SDK architecture docs.

## Recipes

| Recipe | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| [Google Gmail Integration](integrations/google-gmail-README.md) | Users should connect their own Gmail accounts to KDCube, and KDCube tools should search or send Gmail with connected-account claims. |
| [Mail Named Service Over MCP](integrations/mail-named-service-README.md) | Connected Gmail/iCloud/Yahoo-style accounts should appear to external agents as one provider-neutral `mail` namespace through the generic named-services MCP surface. |
| [Slack Integration](integrations/slack-README.md) | Users should connect their own Slack accounts or workspaces to KDCube, and KDCube tools should search or post through Slack with connected-account claims. |
| [Telegram Integration](integrations/telegram-README.md) | A bundle exposes a Telegram webhook and Mini App, and Telegram users should connect to KDCube through Connection Hub before using platform-backed features. |
| [Link From External Channel](link-from-external-channel-README.md) | A user starts inside Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, a partner app, or another runtime that already carries provider auth material, and must create a connection edge to their KDCube platform user. |
| [Set Up A Platform Authority Provider](platform-authority/setup-platform-authority-README.md) | A deployment needs to choose and configure the platform authority method: Cognito/multi-Cognito, SimpleIDP, or bundle-hosted platform session. |
| [Host A Platform Authority Flow In A Bundle](platform-authority/host-platform-authority-in-bundle-README.md) | A deployment wants a bundle-owned login UI/flow, such as Google login without Cognito, while Connection Hub owns platform authority registration and policy. |
| [Use Connected Identities In A Product Feature](use-connected-identities-in-product-feature-README.md) | A product feature stores data by runtime actor, but should read one coherent set across the current user's connected identities. |
| [Protect Bundle MCP With Managed Credentials](protect-bundle-mcp-with-managed-credentials-README.md) | A bundle exposes MCP tools and wants Connection Hub to manage delegated external-client access with per-tool grants. |
| [Protect REST With Managed Credentials](protect-bundle-rest-with-managed-credentials-README.md) | An application REST operation or configured platform REST resource should accept delegated bearer tokens with per-operation grants. |
| [Create Delegated Automation Access](create-delegated-automation-access-README.md) | A signed-in user needs to mint a short-lived bearer token for an automation, including admin-only all-resource access for platform admins. |
| [Delegate A KDCube Service To An External Client](delegate-kdcube-service-to-external-client-README.md) | A user wants to connect Claude or another external client to a KDCube service with explicit consent and least-privilege tools. |
