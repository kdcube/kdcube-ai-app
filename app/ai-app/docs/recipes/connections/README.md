# Connection Recipes

These recipes are practical entry points for building with Connection Hub. They
are intentionally shorter and more task-oriented than the SDK architecture docs.

## Recipes

| Recipe | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| [Link From External Channel](link-from-external-channel-README.md) | A user starts inside Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, a partner app, or another runtime that already carries provider auth material, and must create a connection edge to their KDCube platform user. |
| [Use Connected Identities In A Product Feature](use-connected-identities-in-product-feature-README.md) | A product feature stores data by runtime actor, but should read one coherent set across the current user's connected identities. |
| [Protect Bundle MCP With Managed Credentials](protect-bundle-mcp-with-managed-credentials-README.md) | A bundle exposes MCP tools and wants Connection Hub to manage delegated external-client access with per-tool grants. |
| [Delegate A KDCube Service To An External Client](delegate-kdcube-service-to-external-client-README.md) | A user wants to connect Claude or another external client to a KDCube service with explicit consent and least-privilege tools. |
