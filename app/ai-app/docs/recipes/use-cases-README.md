# Recipe Index: What Problem Does KDCube Solve?

Problem in, solution out. Each entry states a problem the way practitioners
state it, names the mechanism that answers it, and links the deep docs for the
HOW. Use the index to find the problem; use the entry to confirm the fit.

## 1. Scheduled pipelines that sometimes need judgement

Problem: "Most agent use cases can be done with a cron that calls an LLM."

Correct — the **trigger** decides:

- **Clock + known path → cron.** `@cron` / `@on_job` run fixed pipeline steps
  (gather, rank, publish) in production.
- **A person asks → agent turn.** One open intent across domains; the plan is
  made mid-turn.
- **An event fires → agent turn.** Alerts and callbacks land in the app's
  `@on_reactive_event` hook; they start work or extend a live turn.
- **A wall appears → dialogue.** Missing consent becomes a one-click question —
  and dialogue is not schedulable.

Both run in the same app, on the same budget line; a scheduled step that starts
needing judgement becomes an agent turn without a rewrite.

## 2. Agents and the keys to your accounts

Problem: "I built credential handling for my agents myself — and every week
something breaks."

```text
BUILD IT YOURSELF                          WITH KDCUBE
OAuth per provider · token store           Connection Hub: a claims broker
refresh scheduling · live-401 recovery  →  tools resolve claims, never keys
scope upgrades · revocation · failure UX   structured denials with the fix
```

- **Tools resolve claims, never keys** — the broker returns a short-lived
  credential handle; client secrets live in descriptors tool code cannot read.
- **Live 401 → refresh once → retry once** → only then mark the account and
  show a reconnect card with the provider's real error.
- **Every denial is structured:** reason, labeled account candidates, fix URL,
  retry hint.
- **External agents get their own grants** (`mail:read`, `slack:write`) —
  separate from provider claims, revocable, consent-snapshot-bound.

## 3. One workspace, many humans

Problem: ten colleagues sharing agents, data, budgets, and integrations — with
each person's things staying theirs.

- **Per-user everything:** conversations, memories, boards, connected accounts,
  budgets — identity (tenant/project/user) travels through every layer.
- **Per-user tuning inside an admin grant:** users toggle tools and pick models
  from the chat composer; nothing widens beyond the grant (entry 13).
- **The scene is the shared room:** summonable widgets, auth-gated, with
  cross-widget drag resolving under the dragging user's identity.
- **Per-user economics from day one:** budgets, live usage, who spent what on
  which agent.

Docs: [scene](components/scene-README.md) ·
[economics](../sdk/bundle/bundle-economics-integration-README.md)

## 4. Context that stays lean as capability grows

Problem: the context fills with tool definitions, stale history, and copied
payloads — quality drops before the window overflows.

```text
BUILD IT YOURSELF                          WITH KDCUBE
tool-list pruning · payload truncation     one fixed grammar (~10 generic ops)
base64 handling · window management     →  lean hits + refs · bytes as signed
summarizer pipeline · cache-aware layout   URLs · cached front + uncached tail
```

- **Tools:** ~ten generic operations replace one-tool-per-integration; domains
  self-describe at runtime.
- **Payloads:** search returns lean hits (ref · title · snippet); `get` fetches
  on demand; binaries travel as signed URLs.
- **History:** past turns are searchable (`conv:`), never replayed; working
  summaries compress each turn.
- **Cache:** durable instructions stay cached; the per-turn ANNOUNCE tail
  carries only what changed (entry 14 for the cost story).

[context caching](../sdk/agents/react/context-caching-README.md) ·
[file hosting](resource_sharing/hosting-README.md)

## 5. Knowing where the context came from

Problem: when an answer is wrong, the lineage of what the agent saw is the
first thing needed — and usually the first thing lost.

- **Everything is a ref** (`conv:fi:…`, `mem:…`, `cnv:…`) that both sides
  resolve later; context enters as addressable objects, never pasted text.
- **Search hits carry their paths** back to the turn and event they came from.
- **Board pins keep provenance;** sharing a board shares it.
- **The per-turn timeline is the ledger:** what the agent read, produced, and
  executed is a query.

Docs: [canvas / pin board](../sdk/solutions/canvas/canvas-sdk-solution-README.md) ·
[conversation search](../sdk/solutions/conversation/search-README.md)

## 6. Memory that survives the session

Problem: every session starts from zero; the agent asked yesterday and asks
again today.

- **Episodic recall** (`conv:`): the temporal record — every turn indexed with
  its production context. "What did we decide in May" is one search.
- **Durable knowledge** (`mem:`): co-managed typed notes — the agent proposes,
  a reconciler merges, the user edits in the memory widget.
- **Reads can aggregate across the user's linked identity family** — one
  person, several sign-ins, one memory.
- **Both feed the turn** as retrieved, cited context under the lean-hits
  discipline.

[reconciliation](../sdk/memory/user-memories-reconcilation-README.md) ·
[conversation recall](../sdk/solutions/conversation/search-README.md)

## 7. Working the company's mail and Slack on delegated trust

Problem: the assistant should search my Gmail and post to our Slack; an
all-powerful token is out of the question.

- **Two consents, explicit:** the user connects the provider once, choosing
  exact claims; the agent receives only the namespace grants approved for it —
  revocable, never wider.
- **A missing account never blocks the turn:** tools with unmet claims drop for
  that turn and the agent learns it in ANNOUNCE
  (`[INACTIVE TOOLS THIS TURN]`), with a connect hint naming the provider and
  tools.
- **Multi-account is explicit:** labeled results; actions never pick an account
  silently.
- **Files cross the boundary** through signed download URLs and upload slots —
  bytes over HTTP, never inside tool calls.

Docs: [mail over MCP](connections/integrations/mail-named-service-README.md) ·
[Slack integration](connections/integrations/slack-README.md) ·
[file hosting](resource_sharing/hosting-README.md)

## 8. From notebook to production app, updated live

Problem: production means REST, streaming, MCP in and out, jobs, widgets,
secrets, zero-downtime upgrades — the AI part becomes the smallest problem.

- **One unit carries it all:** agents, API operations, cron jobs, MCP surfaces,
  widgets with their build pipeline, config/secrets contract.
- **The platform supplies the rest:** ingress, auth, per-user accounting,
  isolation, hot reload, CI/CD.
- **Upgrades are descriptor changes,** applied to a live deployment.
- **Products compose as apps of apps,** each upgraded independently.

Docs: [app developer guide](../sdk/bundle/bundle-developer-guide-README.md) ·
[delivery & update](../sdk/bundle/bundle-delivery-and-update-README.md)

## 9. A coding agent inside automation, trusted by machines

Problem: a human reviews a coding agent's work with their eyes; a pipeline
can't.

- **Dedicated, mapped workspace** per session — the agent works only there.
- **Framed structured output:** the agent declares what it did, in which files.
- **Validators inspect exactly the declared edits;** only validated work is
  committed.
- **Deterministic session binding** to user + conversation — follow-up and
  steer turns resume the same context.

Docs: [Claude Code agent](../sdk/agents/claude/claude-code-README.md) ·
[app agent integration](../sdk/bundle/bundle-agent-integration-README.md)

## 10. Machine access that is born disposable

Problem: a script files tasks every night; nobody wants it holding a person's
session.

- **A token bound to declared resources and grants,** with an expiry, created
  and revoked in the Connection Hub UI.
- **Grant checks use the matching resource entry** — never a global union of
  every grant on the token.
- **Revocation is immediate:** record deleted, bound session logged out, next
  call rejected.
- **Same guard rails as human access** — per-operation grants, accounting.

Docs: [delegated automation access](connections/create-delegated-automation-access-README.md)

## 11. Generated code you can trust like a tool

Problem: the agent writes useful code — and the only way to run it is a shell
tool with the agent's hands on it.

- **Declare, then run:** the agent submits code and declares the expected
  output files — user-facing deliverables vs internal intermediates.
- **Run in isolation:** Docker ISO runtime with a split container strategy,
  quotas, and a monitor; isolation level is deployment config, never agent
  choice.
- **Outputs honor the contract:** user-facing files are hosted and shown —
  delivery verified, never assumed (`delivery_failed.file_hosting` fires
  otherwise); everything, including failures, lands in the turn timeline.
- **Bounded I/O composes with tool guards** — accounting, inventories, user
  toggles.

[app runtime](../sdk/bundle/bundle-runtime-README.md) ·
[custom tools & declared files](../sdk/tools/custom-tools-README.md)

## 12. Agent output the web can actually find

Problem: the agent produces excellent reports — and they live in chat, where no
search engine, shared link, or newsletter reaches them.

- **The app declares a public-content provider** (`@public_content`): the
  platform renders crawlable HTML with JSON-LD, canonical and OG tags at stable
  URLs.
- **Sitemaps come from the registry:** publish and retract update the per-alias
  sitemap; a retracted item serves `410`.
- **Publishing is an operation** — batched, so a nightly pipeline and a Publish
  button are the same code path.
- **A CDN fronts the origin through rewrite mapping;** the app remains the
  single source of truth.

[public content provider](../sdk/bundle/public-content-provider-README.md) ·
[publish recipe](resource_sharing/publish-discoverable-content-README.md)

## 13. One agent config, many users

Problem: "Every user wants a different agent — fewer tools, a cheaper model, no
MCP — and we ship one config."

```text
BUILD IT YOURSELF                          WITH KDCUBE
per-user feature flags · allow-list UI     admin grant ∩ user pick
per-user model routing · storage        →  composer "+" menu · per turn
permission clamping · staleness            fail-open, never wider
```

- **Config grants the inventory:** `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<id>` declares
  the tools/skills; the admin-allowed model list is `supported_models`.
- **The chat "+" menu narrows it:** deny-lists for tools, skills, MCP servers,
  and namespaces, plus one model pick — stored per (user, app, agent).
- **Applied per turn as `configured ∩ chosen`,** clamped on write, fail-open —
  a broken selection never breaks the agent.
- **New config entries default ON for everyone;** system tools stay locked on.

[user settings](../sdk/solutions/user-settings/user-settings-solution-README.md) ·
[chat with a ReAct agent](components/chat-with-react-agent-README.md)

## 14. Prompt-cache costs nobody can attribute

Problem: long conversations get expensive, and cache rebuilds are invisible —
nobody can say which action caused what spend.

- **Placement by lifecycle:** durable teaching lives in the cached
  instructions; turn-local state in the uncached ANNOUNCE tail — the volatile
  costs nothing.
- **Every deliberate invalidation is marked:** the `[CACHE]` cold-turn marker
  and `cache_cold_turn` accounting metadata join the rebuild premium to the
  causing action — one identifiable component within the turn's spend sum.
- **The user holds the policy:** accept · confirm · defer-cold ·
  defer-conversation (admin default + bounds); under confirm the composer turns
  a costly switch into an inline choice.
- **Both switches are named, neither silent:** a model pick rebuilds in a
  per-model cache namespace; a capability toggle colds one turn, then caching
  resumes.

[construct a ReAct agent](../sdk/agents/react/how/how-to-construct-react-agent-README.md) ·
[user settings](../sdk/solutions/user-settings/user-settings-solution-README.md)

## 15. Every new internal tool is a new frontend project

Problem: every team needs its workspace page — chat here, tasks there, usage
somewhere — and each one becomes its own web app.

- **Components are served widgets** iframed from their owning apps — declared
  in `surfaces.as_consumer.ui.scene.components` (`bundle_id` +
  `widget_alias`).
- **Behavior is config:** `placement: docked|floating`, `rail`, `gated` auth,
  `drop` patterns routed to a `target_surface`.
- **Context moves across surfaces:** cross-surface drag and provider-resolved
  open actions are built into the host.
- **The reusable host is `@kdcube/components-react/scene`** — a new alias
  mounts any deployed app's widget.

Docs: [scene configuration](../sdk/solutions/scene/config/README.md) ·
[scene recipe](components/scene-README.md)

## 16. The answer arrives while the agent is still working

Problem: the agent asks for something — an approval, a callback, a human — and
the answer shows up mid-run.

- **Every conversation carries an ordered event lane;** systems the agent
  triggers answer back into it.
- **A live turn folds arriving events mid-work;** otherwise they wait as the
  context the next turn opens with. The consent flow is the worked story: the
  grant lands as an event and the agent circles back and finishes.
- **Events inform; reactive hooks act:** a lane event never starts a turn by
  itself — starting work is the explicit `@on_reactive_event` contract.
- **Folding is total:** every consumed event advances the turn's bookkeeping —
  an unreadable event can never wedge a completion.

[app events](../sdk/bundle/bundle-events-README.md) ·
[Connection Hub](../sdk/solutions/connections/connection-hub-solution-README.md)

## The pattern behind the answers

Four moves recur: **identity travels everywhere** · **context holds handles,
the platform holds bytes** · **domains describe themselves behind a fixed
grammar** · **every denial explains its own fix**.
