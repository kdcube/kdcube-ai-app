# Economics subsystem

This subsystem controls:
1) **Economic rate limiting** (requests/tokens/concurrency; per-user; plan-aware)
2) **Charging** (who pays for each request: plan quota/funding first, wallet overflow second, project absorption last)
3) **Budgets** (plan quotas, plan overrides, user lifetime credits, project money)
4) **Top-ups** (admin top-ups, subscription top-ups, Stripe credit purchases)

It is designed so:
- **Rate limiting is fast** (Redis counters + Lua for atomic ops).
- **Money/accounting is correct** (PostgreSQL row locks + ledger).
- **User credits are concurrency-safe** (reservations prevent oversubscription).

---

## Terminology

- **Plan** = quota policy identity (limits for requests/tokens/concurrency).
- **Plan override** = temporary per‑user override of plan limits.
- **Funding split** = one pass: the primary source (subscription/project) covers `plan_part`, the wallet covers the over‑quota remainder.

## Namespaces (Redis)

All Redis keys must use `kdcube_ai_app.infra.namespaces.REDIS`.

Economics:
- `REDIS.ECONOMICS.RATE_LIMIT = "kdcube:economics:rl"`
- `REDIS.ECONOMICS.PROJ_BUDGET = "kdcube:economics:proj.budget"`
- `REDIS.ECONOMICS.PLAN_BALANCE_CACHE = "kdcube:economics:plan.balance"`

Important: changing namespaces changes the Redis key-space (effectively resets usage counters unless you dual-read/migrate).

---

## Data model overview

### A) User plan overrides + credits (PostgreSQL)
**Tables:**
- `kdcube_control_plane.user_plan_overrides` — temporary plan overrides (expires).
- `kdcube_control_plane.user_lifetime_credits` — wallet credits (lifetime tokens).

### B) User credit reservations (PostgreSQL)
**Table:** `kdcube_control_plane.user_token_reservations`

This is how we prevent concurrent requests from spending the same user credits twice.
Reservations are short-lived (TTL) and are either:
- `reserved` → then later `committed` or `released`
- auto-ignored after expiry

### C) Plan quota policies (PostgreSQL)
**Table:** `kdcube_control_plane.plan_quota_policies`

- Base quota envelopes keyed by `plan_id`.
- Runtime resolves `plan_id` per request and applies these limits.
 - Reservation floor default lives in the economics descriptor (`reservation.chat`, editable in the admin UI **Reservation** card); a bundle may override it via `config.economics.reservation.<floor>` (legacy `economics.reservation_amount_dollars`).

Wallet + no subscription behavior:
- Plan remains `free`.
- Service limits (requests/concurrency) come from `wallet`.
- Token limits come from `free`.

Subscription + wallet behavior:
- Plan remains the subscription plan.
- Subscription balance funds the maximum portion allowed by subscription balance and plan quota.
- Wallet covers only the remaining overflow. Wallet-paid tokens do **not** consume plan quota.
- If actual spend exceeds both plan funding and wallet, project budget absorbs the remainder (ledger note indicates shortfall). If plan quota remains, that absorbed remainder also consumes quota. Tags: `shortfall:wallet_subscription`, `shortfall:wallet_plan`, `shortfall:subscription_overage`, `shortfall:free_plan`.
- If the subscription budget can't fully fund a turn, the over‑quota remainder is covered by the **wallet** via the unified split.

Subscription only (no wallet):
- Subscription covers the full reservation.
- If actual spend exceeds reservation, **project budget absorbs the overage** (`shortfall:subscription_overage`).

Request lineage:
- Chat requests use the chat **turn_id** as `request_id`.
- Non-chat top-level flows must use their own stable accountable request id.
- `GET /economics/request-lineage?request_id=<request_id>` returns the ledger + reservation rows.

### D) Economic RL (Redis)
**Module:** `UserEconomicsRateLimiter`

Tracks (quota counters are global per tenant/project; accounting still uses bundle = product):
- Concurrency: ZSET lock (members have expiry timestamps)
- Requests: rolling‑day / rolling‑30‑day / total counters
- Tokens: rolling‑hour / rolling‑day / rolling‑30‑day counters
- Last turn: `last_turn_tokens`, `last_turn_at`
- Bundle index: `kdcube:economics:rl:bundles:{subject_id}` (set of bundle IDs, 90‑day TTL)

Policy source:
- Base policy comes from **plan_id** (not role).
- Optional plan override is pulled from `user_plan_overrides` and merged as **OVERRIDE** (not additive).

Window semantics:
- Hourly tokens: **rolling 60‑minute** window (minute buckets).
- Daily requests/tokens: **current 24‑hour quota period since the last daily reset**. API fields still use `requests_today` / `tokens_today` names for backward compatibility.
- Monthly requests/tokens: **current 30‑day quota period since the last monthly reset**.

### D) Project budget (money) (PostgreSQL + Redis analytics)
**Module:** `ProjectBudgetLimiter`

- **PostgreSQL**: `tenant_project_budget` (balance + reserved + overdraft_limit)
- **PostgreSQL**: `tenant_project_budget_reservations` (per-request holds)
- **PostgreSQL**: `tenant_project_budget_ledger` (signed ledger)

- **Redis**: analytics counters per bundle/provider (hour/day/month spend)

The money “source of truth” is PostgreSQL.
Redis is for fast spend reporting / analytics only.

# Phases

## Phase 1 — Economic Rate Limiting (Economical RL)

**Goal:** decide quickly if a request may start.

Inputs:
- `subject_id = "{tenant}:{project}:{user_id}"` (or session-scoped variant)
- `bundle_id` (product id for accounting/analytics)
- `base_policy` (derived from `plan_id`)
- optional plan override (from `user_plan_overrides`)

Process:
1) Load plan override (if enabled) and compute **effective policy**:
    - If override exists and is not expired → override any configured limits.
    - Otherwise use base policy.

2) Read current counters from Redis (global quota scope):
   - Global quota counters use bundle id `__project__` in Redis keys.
    - reqs: rolling‑day / rolling‑30‑day / total
    - toks: rolling‑hour / rolling‑day / rolling‑30‑day

3) Check policy violations:
    - requests_per_day / month / total
    - tokens_per_hour / day / month

4) If allowed, attempt concurrency lock (Lua + ZSET):
    - ZREM expired holders (by score)
    - if ZCARD >= max_concurrent → deny
    - else ZADD(lock_id, expire_ts)

Output:
- `AdmitResult(allowed, reason, lock_id, snapshot, used_plan_override, effective_policy)`  
  (field means “plan override used”)

Important semantics:
- Token limits are **post‑paid**: checks are based on committed counters from previous turns.
- The user-facing counters show active quota buckets: last 60 minutes for hourly, current 24-hour period for daily, and current 30-day period for monthly.
- Concurrency lock is released at commit (or forced release on error).

## Customer-facing billing widget

The customer widget at `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/ingress/economics/UserBillingDashboard.tsx` is intended to explain the user-facing side of economics for the authenticated user.

- `GET /api/economics/me/budget-breakdown` resolves the effective plan for the authenticated user.
- By default, the endpoint uses limiter bundle id `__project__`, which matches the real quota scope enforced at runtime.
- This means the usage shown in the widget is combined across all bundles/apps in the same tenant/project, not scoped to the currently loaded app.
- The widget should present:
  - `Last 60 minutes`, `Current 24h quota period`, and `Current 30-day quota period` usage,
  - remaining headroom for each window,
  - reset timestamps for the same project-wide quota buckets,
  - personal lifetime credit balance,
  - the rule that requests larger than remaining plan quota require personal credits for the overflow.

This is important because app/project budget alone does not explain a blocked free user: a user can still be blocked when plan headroom is low and personal credits are zero, even if project budget remains available. The user-facing widget therefore needs to describe the quota that is actually enforced, which is global across the tenant/project.

## Diagnostics script

For one-user investigations, use:

- `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/infra/economics/profile_user_economics.py`

Purpose:
- profile one user’s current quota state,
- show current usage, remaining headroom, and reset timing,
- show wallet / subscription / project budget context,
- simulate whether a typical next turn would overflow plan quota and require personal credits.

Typical usage:

```bash
python /app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/infra/economics/profile_user_economics.py \
  --tenant <tenant> \
  --project <project> \
  --user-id <user_id> \
  --role registered \
  --rl-bundle-id __project__ \
  --reservation-amount-dollars 2.0
```

Notes:
- Run it inside the processor container or any environment that has the same economics config, Redis, and PostgreSQL access as the running service.
- `--rl-bundle-id` should usually remain `__project__` because quota counters are global per tenant/project.
- The script is diagnostic: token counters and balances are authoritative, while some USD/token conversions are reference-price estimates.

## Phase 2 — How we charge the user

Charging happens after the model run, when we know the actual tokens spent.

Charging order:
1) **User lifetime credits** (if any) — token-based, depleting
2) **Project budget** — money-based, deducted from tenant/project balance

### 2.1 User lifetime credits (token budget)
Module: `UserCreditsManager`
- Reserve before work (optional but strongly recommended):
    - `reserve_lifetime_tokens(...)`
- Commit after we know actual token usage:
    - `commit_reserved_lifetime_tokens(...)`
- Any amount not covered becomes `overflow_tokens`.

If you skip reservations, use:
- `consume_lifetime_tokens(...)`  
  which will NOT steal from other active reservations.

### 2.2 Project budget (money)
Module: `ProjectBudgetLimiter`
- Recommended flow:
    - `reserve(amount_usd_estimate)` before running the model
    - `commit_reserved_spend(spent_usd_actual)` after completion
- Legacy flow:
    - `commit(spent_usd)` (no reservation)

If actual spend > reserved estimate, the delta is also charged and overdraft‑checked. This applies **only** to the project budget. **Subscriptions and wallets never go negative.**

Project budget overdraft:
- overdraft_limit == NULL → unlimited negative allowed
- overdraft_limit == 0 → no overdraft allowed
- otherwise can go negative up to the limit

---

## Phase 3 — Budgets we have and how to manage them

We have 4 “budget dimensions”:

### 3.1 Base plan quotas (per plan_id)
Stored as policies (control plane):
- `plan_quota_policies` keyed by `plan_id`
- Enforced by Economic RL (Redis counters, global per tenant/project)

### 3.2 Plan override (temporary replacement)
Stored in `user_plan_overrides`, with optional expiry.
Semantics: **OVERRIDE**, not additive.

Use cases:
- trials
- promos
- compensation
- admin “grant user more limits for N days”

### 3.3 User lifetime credits (depleting token bucket)
Stored in `user_lifetime_credits`:
- lifetime_tokens_purchased
- lifetime_tokens_consumed

Concurrency-safe via `user_token_reservations`.

Use cases:
- one-time purchases (Stripe payments)
- manual grants

### 3.4 Project budget (money)
Stored in `tenant_project_budget` and ledger.
Used when:
- user credits are insufficient OR not present
- plan admits the request but funding is project‑paid (registered role)

Common management operations:
- top up
- set overdraft limit (project budget only)
- reconcile via ledger

---

## Phase 4 — Top-ups

### 4.1 Top up project budget (money)
- Admin endpoint: `/app-budget/topup`
- Subscription scheduler can do this monthly
- Stripe “invoice.paid” can also do this for subscriptions

### 4.2 Override plan (temporary)
- Admin endpoints:
    - `/plan-override/grant-trial`
    - `/plan-override/update` (partial updates)

### 4.3 Add user lifetime credits (token budget)
- Admin endpoint: `/plan-override/add-lifetime-credits`
- Stripe `payment_intent.succeeded` (credits purchase)

# Integration points for Subscription + Payments

See:
- Subscription creation + monthly charging module (internal “imitated billing”)
- Stripe webhook handler (real money events)
- Control plane endpoints (manual admin operations)

Engineers integrating payment systems should treat:
- Project budget topups as “revenue credited”
- User lifetime credits as “prepaid token credits”
- Tier override as “temporary quota override”
