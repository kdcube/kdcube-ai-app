# Background Job Streams

This stream family transports bundle-owned work that is already ready to run.

It is not a generic event bus, and it is not the conversation scheduler.

## Core Contract

Redis Streams are used as a transport for jobs that are ready to run. They do
not decide when work is due. Scheduling remains a producer concern: a cron job,
bundle scheduler, admin action, widget action, or internal service detects
ready work and enqueues a job.

The platform routes the envelope. The bundle owns the domain payload.

## Ownership

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Job producer | Detect due work, create any domain records, choose `work_kind`, `job_id`, `dedupe_key`, `metadata`, and `payload`. |
| Redis job stream | Persist ready jobs, dedupe submissions, expose consumer-group claiming and recovery. |
| Processor | Fairly poll chat work and background work, build a normal request context, and invoke the bundle job handler. |
| Bundle `@on_job` | Interpret `work_kind`, read bundle-owned records, execute the work, and update bundle-owned state. |

The platform must not understand bundle-specific job payloads.

## Job Envelope

Top-level fields are platform-visible:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `job_id` | Stable logical id used for locks, logs, and idempotency. |
| `work_kind` | Bundle-agreed operation name, for example `task.execution.due`. |
| `tenant`, `project`, `bundle_id` | Routing target. |
| `user_id`, `user_type`, `queue` | Runtime user context and fairness queue. |
| `dedupe_key` | Optional producer-chosen idempotency key. |
| `source` | Small audit object such as `scheduler`, `admin`, or `widget`. |
| `metadata` | Transport hints such as `conversation_id`, `turn_id`, `text`, `timezone`, `roles`. |
| `payload` | Bundle-owned domain payload, for example `{ "task_id": "...", "execution_id": "..." }`. |
| `created_at` | Unix timestamp for queue wait metrics. |

`metadata` and `payload` are JSON objects. The submitter and receiver can agree
on their contents, but the processor should only use generic metadata needed to
create the runtime context.

## Processing

```text
producer
  |
  | detect due work
  | create bundle-owned durable record
  | choose job_id / dedupe_key / work_kind
  v
RedisBackgroundJobStream.enqueue(...)
  |
  | XADD ready job envelope
  v
Redis Stream by tenant/project/queue
  |
  | XREADGROUP / XAUTOCLAIM
  v
proc worker
  |
  | acquire per-task lock
  | build ExternalEventPayload
  | bind bundle_call_context.kind=background_job
  v
bundle @on_job
  |
  | load bundle-owned record
  | execute idempotently
  | persist result/status/artifacts
  v
proc ACK
  |
  | XACK only after handler returns
  v
stream pending entry cleared
```

1. A producer calls `RedisBackgroundJobStream.enqueue(...)`.
2. The stream writes to a tenant/project stream by queue, for example registered-user jobs and privileged jobs.
3. The processor loop polls chat work and background work in a simple round-robin.
4. For background work, the processor uses a Redis Stream consumer group and `XAUTOCLAIM` to recover idle pending jobs.
5. The processor builds a `ExternalEventPayload` with operation `__kdcube_on_job__`
   and sets `bundle_call_context.kind=background_job`.
6. The proc runtime loads the target bundle and calls its async `@on_job` method.
7. The stream message is acknowledged only after the handler returns. Cancellation leaves the message pending for recovery.

`@on_job` handlers must be async. There is no sync fallback for job handlers.

## Chat Ingress Submit Helper

Some proc-hosted integrations need to accept a webhook/API request and submit a
normal chat turn without keeping the webhook open until the turn completes.
Those surfaces use `ChatIngressSubmitter.submit(...)`, not the background job
stream.

Example caller:

```python
result = await submit(
    session=session,
    request_context=request_context,
    message_data=message_data,
    message_text=processed_text,
    ingress=ingress,
    raw_attachments=raw_attachments,
)
result_payload = asdict(result)
```

That helper is a proc-local adapter around the canonical chat ingestion path:

```text
webhook / bundle API
  |
  v
ChatIngressSubmitter.submit(...)
  |
  v
process_chat_message(...)
  |
  v
normal chat queue / relay / conversation persistence
```

Use it when the work is a chat turn and should appear as normal assistant
conversation activity. Use `RedisBackgroundJobStream` when the work is a
bundle-owned background job handled by `@on_job`.

## Bundle Job Dispatch

A bundle has one `@on_job` handler. The handler receives the background job
envelope and should dispatch by inspecting `work_kind` and `payload`.

Mixin-provided job handlers should be exposed as normal methods, not as
additional `@on_job` methods. A bundle that derives from such a mixin should call
the superclass dispatcher first:

```python
@on_job
async def on_job(self, **kwargs):
    handled = await super().handle_job(**kwargs)
    if handled.get("handled"):
        return handled

    job = kwargs.get("job") or {}
    work_kind = kwargs.get("work_kind") or job.get("work_kind")
    ...
```

This keeps the platform rule simple: there is exactly one decorated job entry
point per bundle, and the bundle owns dispatch for concrete job kinds.

## Task And Memo Pattern

The task-and-memo bundle uses this pattern:

| Producer | Job kind | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Due-task cron scan | `task.execution.due` | `task_id`, `execution_id`, `due_slot` |
| Widget/API run-now action | `task.execution.manual` | `task_id`, `execution_id` |

The producer creates a queued execution first. The queued execution is the
user-visible source of truth. The job stream only transports the ready work.

If the job then starts a nested tool/agent runtime, put task ids and other
agreed metadata in the reserved `bundle_call_context` instead of asking the
model to repeat those ids as tool arguments.

The bundle `@on_job` handler then:

1. Validates `work_kind`.
2. Loads the task and execution by id.
3. Recreates a fresh task-run conversation context.
4. Runs the configured task execution agent.
5. Updates the execution journal, status, result, and artifacts.

## Idempotency

```text
duplicate due scan
  |
  v
producer domain record check
  |
  | already exists
  v
do not enqueue duplicate

duplicate stream submission
  |
  v
dedupe_key SET NX
  |
  | already held
  v
return duplicate

handler retry after crash
  |
  v
@on_job loads existing execution/result record
  |
  v
continue or no-op according to bundle state
```

Use both layers:

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Producer domain state | Prevent duplicate domain records for the same due slot or request. |
| Stream `dedupe_key` | Prevent duplicate ready-work submissions across processes. |
| Job handler | Treat retry as possible and update existing execution records by id. |

For scheduled tasks, a good dedupe key is:

```text
<bundle_id>:<user_id>:<task_id>:<due_slot>
```

For manual run-now jobs, duplicate submission may be allowed because each
click/request intentionally creates a new execution.

## What This Is Not

Background job streams should not be used as:

- telemetry ingestion for every usage event
- a generic bundle subscription system
- chat conversation scheduling
- live client event delivery

If the data is an observation such as `mcp.call`, `tool.invoke`, `llm.call`,
`comm.event`, or `client.log.warning`, use the telemetry stream contract
instead.
