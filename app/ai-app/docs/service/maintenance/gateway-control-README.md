# Gateway Control Maintenance

Use this when a development or operations incident leaves gateway throttling
state behind after a client bug, bad auth state, IDP switch, or burst test.
Prefer targeted key deletion over flushing Redis.

## Rate-Limit Key Shape

Gateway rate-limit keys are tenant/project scoped:

```text
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:ratelimit:<session_id>:burst
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:ratelimit:<session_id>:hour:<epoch-hour>
```

The burst key is a short-window sorted set. The hourly key is a counter. Both
are keyed by `session_id`, not by user type alone.

## Anonymous Users

Anonymous users are not all grouped into one shared limiter. The gateway first
maps the request to an anonymous session:

```text
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:session:anonymous:<fingerprint>
```

The fingerprint is derived from client IP and user agent. In local development,
the same browser, IP, and user agent normally reuse the same anonymous session
until the session TTL expires or the session key is deleted. Multiple tabs and
reloads can therefore share the same anonymous burst budget.

Effect:

- One noisy anonymous browser can rate-limit itself across tabs/reloads.
- Other browsers or different user agents usually get different anonymous sessions.
- Deleting rate-limit keys does not clear stale browser cookies or local session state.
- After changing IDP/auth mode, also clear the browser cookies/session storage or use a fresh browser profile.

## Reset Anonymous Rate Limits

If you know the `session_id`, delete only that session's rate-limit keys:

```text
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:ratelimit:<session_id>:burst
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:ratelimit:<session_id>:hour:*
```

In Redis Browser:

1. Open the Redis Browser admin UI.
2. Search with prefix:

```text
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:ratelimit:<session_id>
```

3. Delete the `:burst` key.
4. Delete any matching `:hour:<epoch-hour>` keys if the hourly counter is also exhausted.

If you do not know the session id, search by tenant/project prefix:

```text
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:ratelimit:
```

For local development only, it is usually acceptable to delete all matching
rate-limit keys for the tenant/project. Do not do this in shared environments
unless you intentionally want to clear throttling state for all active sessions.

## Reset Via Admin Endpoint

The control-plane reset endpoint can clear the same keys:

```http
POST /admin/throttling/reset
```

Single session:

```json
{
  "tenant": "<tenant>",
  "project": "<project>",
  "reset_rate_limits": true,
  "reset_backpressure": false,
  "reset_throttling_stats": false,
  "all_sessions": false,
  "session_id": "<session_id>"
}
```

All sessions for one tenant/project:

```json
{
  "tenant": "<tenant>",
  "project": "<project>",
  "reset_rate_limits": true,
  "reset_backpressure": false,
  "reset_throttling_stats": false,
  "all_sessions": true
}
```

Use an authenticated admin user. Keep `reset_backpressure` false unless you are
also recovering from stale capacity counters or queue pressure.

## Backpressure Reset

Backpressure capacity counters are separate from rate-limit counters. Reset
them only when requests are blocked with backpressure/503 symptoms and the
queue/capacity state is known to be stale.

Relevant keys:

```text
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:capacity:counter
<tenant>:<project>:kdcube:system:capacity:counter:total
```

Do not purge chat queues during normal rate-limit recovery. Queue purge drops
pending work and should be reserved for explicit incident recovery.
