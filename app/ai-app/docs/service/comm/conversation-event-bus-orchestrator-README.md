# Conversation Event Bus Orchestrator

The conversation event bus carries accepted conversation-scoped
`external_events[]` batches from ingress to the ReAct runtime. The
orchestrator coordinates the lane through one shared synchronization record
`T`.

`T` is stored beside the conversation external-event lane:

```text
<conversation-external-event-lane-key>:state
<conversation-external-event-lane-key>:state:lock
```

The lane identity is:

```text
tenant + project + user_id + conversation_id + agent_id
```

## State

The table stays intentionally small:

```text
T.handler.turn_id
T.handler.status                         open | closed
T.handler.status_at

T.last_processed_event_timestamp
T.last_processed_reactive_event_timestamp

T.consumer.status                        active | scheduled | none
T.consumer.status_at
```

`T.last_processed_event_timestamp` is the lane processed cursor for all event
types. `T.last_processed_reactive_event_timestamp` is the same cursor for
reactive events only. Both values come from event-envelope timestamps. They
are not Redis Stream ids, sequence numbers, or wall-clock timestamps.

`T.consumer.status_at` is a real lane-local acknowledgement timestamp written
by proc or the Reader/Consumer. It is not derived from processor heartbeat.

## Parties

| Party | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Ingress | Normalize one `external_events[]` batch, prepare lane records, and accept the batch. Reactive batches are accepted only through one atomic Redis operation that writes the lane records and enqueues one wake. |
| Stream | Store accepted lane events. |
| Wake queue | Carry a nudge for the lane, including the first reactive event timestamp. |
| Proc | Read a wake and, under `lock(T)`, decide whether to set `T.consumer.status = scheduled`. |
| BaseWorkflow / ContextBrowser handler setup | When the turn runtime is constructed and before timeline load, write `T.handler.turn_id`, `T.handler.status = open`, and `T.handler.status_at`. |
| ReAct handler close gate | Close the handler only if the candidate answer saw all processed lane events. |
| Reader/Consumer | Start after handler open, set `T.consumer.status = active`, accept lane events into the live turn path while `T.handler.status == open`, and update `T.last_processed_*`. |
| Turn finalization | Persist turn artifacts after the ReAct handler has closed. |
| ContextBrowser post-save handoff | After persistence and before releasing the Reader/Consumer, inspect lane/table state and publish a wake through `EventLaneWakePublisher` when reactive work remains. |

      leave T.handler.status = open
      ReAct reads the updated timeline and continues
    else:
      set T.handler.status = closed
      set T.handler.status_at = now

    EventLaneWakePublisher publishes one wake
        |
        v
Reader / Consumer Release
  set T.consumer.status = none
  set T.consumer.status_at = now
```

Ingress does not decide whether the conversation is idle or busy. It accepts
the batch into the lane and wakes proc when reactive work exists. The lane and
`T` decide scheduling and reader acceptance.

Reactive ingress has one transaction boundary: the lane write and wake enqueue
stand or fall together. If the processor queue rejects the wake because of
backpressure or an enqueue error, ingress rejects the request and does not
write any event from that batch to the lane. Queue mechanics must not mark an
already accepted lane event failed.

The queue admission script receives capacity as a numeric snapshot. It does
not discover process heartbeat keys. Process heartbeat writers maintain a
service-scoped capacity index, and admission reads that bounded index before
running the Redis script.

The wake queue does not choose which lane event is processed. It wakes the
lane. Under the conversation lock, the Reader and ReAct runtime use the lane
state and event timestamps to decide what can be accepted.

## Freshness

Proc freshness checks use explicit inputs:

```text
active_is_fresh =
  T.consumer.status == active
  and now - T.consumer.status_at <= event_bus.consumer.active_ttl_ms

scheduled_is_fresh =
  T.consumer.status == scheduled
  and now - T.consumer.status_at <= event_bus.consumer.scheduled_ttl_ms
```

`now` must come from the same clock source used by the state table. The first
implementation uses Redis-backed state and may use process UTC timestamps
until Redis `TIME` is wired.

## Probe-Based Wakeup

There are two separate channels:

```text
Conversation event lane
  Redis stream of accepted external events for one
  tenant + project + user_id + conversation_id + agent_id lane.
  It contains user events and small control events.

Processor wake queue
  Processor-ready queue item saying "this lane has reactive work".
  It is not itself in the conversation event lane.
```

The handler and the consumer are the same ReAct runtime owner seen from two
angles:

```text
Handler
  owns the turn timeline and close gate.

Consumer
  reads the conversation event lane for that same turn.
```

If the handler is open but its worker died, `T.handler.status = open` can remain
behind. A later turn must distinguish these two cases:

```text
live open handler
  the existing turn is still reading the lane; do not steal it

stale open handler
  the existing turn is gone or no longer reading the lane; reclaim it
```

`T.handler.status_at` does not prove liveness. It only says when the handler
state was written. The live signal is lane consumption:

```text
T.consumer.status_at
  last known consumer acknowledgement timestamp
```

The handler and consumer are the same runtime owner, but
`T.consumer.status_at` is the only timestamp that answers the liveness
question:

```text
fresh consumer_status_at
  an owner recently acknowledged the lane; defer to it

missing or stale consumer_status_at
  no owner has acknowledged the lane recently; reclaim it
```

The reclaim window is a recovery timeout, not a correctness boundary. A live
but starved old turn can still be reclaimed. That is acceptable only if the
old turn detects the ownership switch before it commits output. The ReAct
runtime therefore fences the old turn in two places:

```text
consumer/listener fence
  when the live consumer refreshes the owner lease, acknowledges consumption,
  or accepts lane events, it verifies that T.handler.turn_id is still its turn.

finish fence
  before answer emission and turn persistence, BaseWorkflow asks the
  ContextBrowser to verify that T.handler.turn_id is still this turn.
```

If either fence sees a newer owner, it raises
`ExternalEventLaneTurnSuperseded`. That exception lands in the normal turn
exception path, which removes the current turn from the index. Because the
finish fence runs before committed answer emission and persistence, the
superseded turn does not save a partial or stale turn. The newer owner reads
the last committed turn from the index and proceeds.

```

### Stale-Open Recovery

This is the failure mode the reclaim logic addresses. Turn-A was the owner,
but its worker died or stopped acknowledging the lane. A later wake must not
defer forever to `T.handler.status = open`.

```text
Time ->

L        Q        P        T                         R(turn-A)       R(turn-B)
|        |        |        |                         |               |
| E1     |        |        |                         |               |
|------->| wake   |        |                         |               |
|        |------->| set scheduled                    |               |
|        |        |-------->                         |               |
|        |        |        | open handler=turn-A     |               |
|        |        |        |<------------------------|               |
|        |        |        | consumer=active         |               |
|        |        |        |<------------------------|               |
|        |        |        |                         | crash/reload  |
|        |        |        | handler remains open    X               |
| E2     |        |        |                         |               |
|------->| wake   |        |                         |               |
|        |------->| set scheduled, build turn-B      |               |
|        |        |        |                         |               | open_handler
|        |        |        | sees open turn-A        |               |
|        |        |        | consumer_status_at stale|               |
|        |        |        | reclaim handler=turn-B  |               |
|        |        |        |<---------------------------------------|
|        |        |        | consumer=active         |               |
|        |        |        |<---------------------------------------|
| read E2|        |        |                         |               |
|<-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        |        |        | last_processed=E2       |               |
|        |        |        |<---------------------------------------|
```

If the runtime treats `handler_status_at` as liveness, turn-B may defer forever
to a handler that no longer exists. That blocks the lane even though E2 is
durably accepted and needs a new turn.

### Live-But-Starved Race

This is the important corner case. Turn-A is not dead, but it is starved long
enough for its consumer acknowledgement to become stale. Turn-B is allowed to
reclaim. Correctness depends on turn-A detecting that it no longer owns the
lane before it saves anything.

```text
Time ->

T                         R(turn-A)                         R(turn-B)
|                         |                                 |
| handler=turn-A          |                                 |
| consumer active         |                                 |
|<------------------------|                                 |
|                         | busy/starved, no consumer ack   |
| consumer_status_at stale|                                 |
|                         |                                 | open_handler
| handler=turn-B          |                                 | reclaim succeeds
|<----------------------------------------------------------|
|                         | resumes                         |
|                         | refresh owner or ack consumer   |
|                         | sees handler=turn-B             |
|                         | raises ExternalEventLaneTurnSuperseded
|                         | normal turn exception handler   |
|                         | delete_turn(index_only)         |
|                         | no committed answer/persist     |
```

The same exception can also be raised at `finish_turn`. That covers a case
where the old turn did not touch the lane again after it was reclaimed but is
about to emit or persist its final output.

### Ordering Rule

Normal close-gate ordering uses event-envelope timestamps plus event ids for
same-timestamp disambiguation. It must not infer ordering from turn ids.

## Tested SDK Primitive

The current isolated SDK/runtime primitive is:

```python
orchestrator = ConversationEventBusOrchestrator(table=table)

await orchestrator.schedule_consumer_from_wake(
    wake_event_timestamp="2026-06-10T10:00:00Z",
)

await orchestrator.open_handler(turn_id=turn_id)
await orchestrator.mark_consumer_active(turn_id=turn_id)

await orchestrator.accept_events_for_open_handler(
    events,
    turn_id=turn_id,
    accept=accept_under_lock,
)

await orchestrator.try_close_handler(
    turn_id=turn_id,
    handler_processed_event_timestamp=handler_processed_event_timestamp,
)

await orchestrator.mark_consumer_none(turn_id=turn_id)
```

Wake publication is a separate primitive:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.events.event_bus import (
    EventLaneWakePublisher,
    RedisEventLaneWakeEnqueuer,
)

publisher = EventLaneWakePublisher(
    RedisEventLaneWakeEnqueuer(redis=redis, tenant=tenant, project=project)
)
await publisher.publish_for_event(
    payload=payload,
    event=event,
    tenant=tenant,
    project=project,
    user_id=user_id,
    conversation_id=conversation_id,
    agent_id=agent_id,
    reason="reactive_event",
)
```

The Redis enqueuer writes the wake to the normal processor ready queue for the
tenant/project/user type. The orchestrator does not know the chat queue
implementation, and proc must not scan the lane after task completion to
manufacture post-completion wakeups.

The standalone tests cover:

- stale wake suppression;
- fresh active/scheduled consumer suppression;
- stale active consumer rescheduling;
- full wake -> scheduled -> handler open -> consumer active -> accept -> close path;
- close rejection when ReAct did not see a newly accepted lane event;
- reader rejection after handler close;
- reader/close lock ordering when the Reader has a new event in hand;
- browser-side superseded-turn detection when a running turn sees a newer
  handler owner.
