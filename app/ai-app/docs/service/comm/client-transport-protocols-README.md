# Client Transport Protocols

This document is the client-facing transport contract for talking to the
platform over:

- REST
- SSE
- Socket.IO
- proc integrations (`/api/integrations/*`)

It focuses on what a client can send, what the server accepts, and what the
client should expect back. The same transports may be used by the reusable chat
component, an app main UI, a widget iframe, a public app-specific client, or a
backend adapter.

This is not an app-shape document. An app may have no chat UI at all: it
can expose only APIs, MCP tools, named services, scheduled jobs, Data Bus
handlers, or some combination of those surfaces.

For user/domain events that should enter a conversation ReAct turn, do not infer
behavior from generic REST/Data Bus transport alone. Use the
`external_events[]` conversation-event contract in
[App Conversation Events And ReAct Output](../../sdk/bundle/bundle-conversation-events-and-react-output-README.md)
or the lower-level event journey docs linked from there.

For choosing the client shape first — iframe app UI, direct host browser
client, host-server client, or backend-only KDCube app — read
[How To Integrate With KDCube Apps](../../how-to-integrate-with-kdcube-apps-README.md).

For the reusable chat component, use
[Chat Component Communication](../../sdk/solutions/chat/chat-component-communication-README.md)
and [Chat Stream Events](../../sdk/solutions/chat/chat-stream-events-README.md).

For provider/client contracts that can be exposed through API, MCP, Data Bus,
or local adapters, use
[Namespace Services: Providers](../../sdk/namespace-services/providers-README.md).

This page does not define app-served MCP routes or the full app transport map.
Use:

- [App Transports](../../sdk/bundle/bundle-transports-README.md) for the overall inbound/outbound surface map
- [App Platform Integration](../../sdk/bundle/bundle-platform-integration-README.md) for the exact `@mcp(...)` contract
- [Chat Stream Events](../../sdk/solutions/chat/chat-stream-events-README.md) for the shared event catalog seen after admission

## 1. Transport Overview

| Transport | Typical use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REST | non-streaming APIs | Standard headers/cookies auth. |
| SSE | one-way server-to-client event stream plus `POST /sse/chat` send path | `stream_id` is required on the stream. |
| Socket.IO | bidirectional chat and event delivery | Socket `sid` acts as the peer stream id. |
| Proc integrations | app widgets, app REST operations, custom frontend ↔ app APIs | Supports the same auth context plus peer targeting through a header. |

## 2. Supported Request Headers

These headers are accepted as part of the public client contract.

| Header | Purpose | Configurable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` | Access token for REST/SSE/integrations auth | No |
| `X-ID-Token` | ID token header | Yes, via `ID_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME` |
| `KDC-Stream-ID` | Connected peer identifier carried on REST requests when the client wants server-side events targeted back to that exact peer | Yes, via `STREAM_ID_HEADER_NAME` |
| `X-User-Timezone` | User timezone for server-formatted messages and context | Yes, via `USER_TIMEZONE_HEADER_NAME` |
| `X-User-UTC-Offset` | User UTC offset in minutes | Yes, via `USER_UTC_OFFSET_MIN_HEADER_NAME` |
| `User-Session-ID` | Reuse/verify an existing authenticated user session | No |

Current default values for configurable headers:

| Env var | Default header name |
| --- | --- |
| `ID_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME` | `X-ID-Token` |
| `STREAM_ID_HEADER_NAME` | `KDC-Stream-ID` |
| `USER_TIMEZONE_HEADER_NAME` | `X-User-Timezone` |
| `USER_UTC_OFFSET_MIN_HEADER_NAME` | `X-User-UTC-Offset` |

## 3. Supported Cookies

| Cookie | Purpose | Configurable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `__Secure-LATC` | Access token cookie fallback | Yes, via `AUTH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` |
| `__Secure-LITC` | ID token cookie fallback | Yes, via `ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` |

Current default values:

| Env var | Default cookie name |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` | `__Secure-LATC` |
| `ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` | `__Secure-LITC` |

## 4. Auth Resolution Order

The server resolves auth in this order:

1. explicit transport payload
   REST/integrations/SSE-send headers, or Socket.IO auth payload
2. SSE query params
3. cookies

Practical meaning:

- if you send `Authorization` and `X-ID-Token`, those win
- if SSE cannot set headers, `bearer_token` and `id_token` query params are accepted
- cookies are fallback transport, not the preferred explicit contract

## 5. SSE Contract

### Open stream

`GET /sse/stream`

Supported query params:

| Query param | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream_id` | Yes | Client-provided identifier for the connected peer |
| `user_session_id` | No | Reuse an existing session owned by the authenticated user |
| `bearer_token` | No | Access token fallback when headers are unavailable |
| `id_token` | No | ID token fallback when headers are unavailable |
| `tenant` | No | Override tenant for the stream |
| `project` | No | Override project for the stream |
| `project_events` | No | Set to `true` to receive tenant/project-level service events on this SSE stream |

`stream_id` is the peer identifier later used for direct-delivery semantics.
`project_events=true` is opt-in and should be used only by clients that need
compact project-level updates, such as dashboards or landing-page status
widgets.

After the stream opens, clients should subscribe to the shared chat event catalog. In addition to the main lifecycle routes (`chat_start`, `chat_step`, `chat_delta`, `chat_complete`, `chat_error`, `chat_service`, `conv_status`), ReAct clients should also handle `chat_compaction`. That route carries `env.type = "chat.compaction"` and marks context compaction start/completion while a long turn is still running.

### Send chat request

`POST /sse/chat`

The stream-side client should keep using the same session and peer identity it established on `/sse/stream`.

### Conversation status

`POST /sse/conv_status.get`

Clients should use the same stream/session pairing they established for chat.

## 6. Socket.IO Contract

### Connect auth payload

Use the Socket.IO root namespace `/` and the normal path `/socket.io`:

```ts
const manager = new Manager(baseUrl, {
  path: "/socket.io",
  transports: ["websocket"],
  withCredentials: true,
});

const socket = manager.socket("/", { auth });
```

Do not pass an empty namespace string. The server can accept the underlying
Engine.IO websocket while the browser-side Socket.IO client never reaches the
application-level `connect` state.

The Socket.IO `connect` auth payload may include:

| Auth field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `user_session_id` | Existing session to attach to |
| `bearer_token` | Access token |
| `id_token` | ID token |
| `tenant` | Tenant override |
| `project` | Project override |
| `bundle_id` | App scope for app-issued federated Data Bus tokens. `bundle_id` is the protocol field name. |
| `federated_token` | Short-lived token issued by an app for app-specific clients |

The Socket.IO connection `sid` is the peer stream identifier for direct delivery.

### Send chat request

Socket.IO clients send chat requests through the `chat_message` event.

The logical request contract is the same as `POST /sse/chat`.
The first Socket.IO argument is the event submission object itself, with
top-level `external_events[]`. Do not send a nested `{ "message": ... }`
wrapper.

Socket.IO clients should bind all shared server event routes, including `chat_compaction`. Compaction events are progress/status events; they do not complete the turn and should be appended to the same activity timeline or progress card as other in-progress updates.

---

## 7. Data Bus Contract

Use Data Bus publish for durable app-domain messages that are not chat
turns, such as collaborative board patches or issue updates.

Browser clients may publish through:

- Socket.IO `data_bus.publish`;
- HTTP `POST /sse/data_bus.publish?stream_id=<open-stream-id>` while listening
  on `/sse/stream`.

Both routes accept the same package and write the same normalized message to
the same app Data Bus Redis Stream. The SSE stream itself is still
server-to-client only; the POST is the inbound half.

For how conversation `external_events[]` and Data Bus `messages[]` fit
together, read
[Conversation Event Bus And Data Bus](conversation-event-bus-and-data-bus-README.md).
For the compact routing and partitioning map, read
[Bus Routing And Partitioning](bus-routing-and-partitioning-README.md).

There are two supported auth paths:

- platform-authenticated widgets/main views connect with the normal runtime
  session and token material;
- app-specific clients first call an app endpoint, the app validates that
  upstream context and issues a short-lived federated Data Bus token, and the
  client connects Socket.IO with `federated_token`.

Request shape for both browser transports:

```json
{
  "schema": "kdcube.data_bus.ingress.v1",
  "bundle_id": "example-collab@1-0",
  "messages": [
    {
      "message_id": "dbmsg_2026-06-07-10-20-30-123456789",
      "subject": "example.document.patch",
      "object_ref": "document-123",
      "idempotency_key": "client-op-01HX",
      "payload": {
        "base_revision": 17,
        "operations": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The Socket.IO ack or HTTP response confirms that accepted messages were written
to the Data Bus Redis Stream. It does not prove that an app handler exists or
that the domain mutation succeeded. Handler completion, unknown-subject
failures, handler access failures, and domain conflicts are proc-side results
and may arrive later as a `chat_service` event when the app handler/runtime
uses `ctx.reply.*`.

App handler registration:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.data_bus import data_bus_handler

@data_bus_handler(
    subject="example.document.patch",
    partition_by="object_ref",
    ordering="serial_per_partition",
    idempotency="required",
)
async def handle_document_patch(self, ctx, message):
    ...
```

Data Bus is separate from `chat_message`, `/sse/chat`, `external_events[]`, and
ReAct timelines. An app that wants a handled domain message to become visible
to an agent must explicitly bridge it into conversation ingress.

Routing keys:

| Client intent | Field |
| --- | --- |
| Send conversation context to a named internal agent | `target.agent_id` or `external_events[].agent_id` |
| Route durable app-domain work to a handler | `messages[].subject` |
| Serialize durable work for one object | `messages[].object_ref` with handler `partition_by="object_ref"` |

Ingress owns socket auth, federated token scope, JSON bounds, actor/reply
normalization, and stream admission. Proc owns app manifest loading,
app/handler visibility, partition locking, and handler invocation.

See [Data Bus](data-bus-README.md) and
[App Federated Auth For Data Bus](../../sdk/bundle/auth-bundle-federated-README.md).

Server-side app code and trusted tools can publish the same durable messages
without a browser socket by using `comm.data_bus.publish(...)` or
`comm.data_bus.publish_and_wait(...)`; isolated/generated-code runtimes use
`comm_ctx.data_bus_publish(...)` or `comm_ctx.data_bus_publish_and_wait(...)`.
Use that producer path when a tool must mutate app-owned state through the
same `@data_bus_handler(...)` pipeline as a browser action. See
[Data Bus: Producer APIs From App Runtimes](data-bus-README.md#producer-apis-from-bundle-runtimes)
and [App Runtime](../../sdk/bundle/bundle-runtime-README.md#publishing-to-data-bus-from-tools-and-entrypoints).

---

## 8. Shared Chat Send Contract

This is the missing common contract between:

- `POST /sse/chat`
- Socket.IO `chat_message`

Both transports send the same logical chat request.

### Logical message shape

Current request fields:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello",
  "chat_history": [],
  "project": "demo-project",
  "tenant": "demo-tenant",
  "turn_id": "turn_123",
  "conversation_id": "conv_123",
  "bundle_id": "my.app@1-0",
  "message_kind": "regular|followup|steer",
  "continuation_kind": "regular|followup|steer",
  "active_turn_id": "turn_current",
  "target_turn_id": "turn_current",
  "steer": true,
  "followup": true
}
```

Important:

- `message_kind` / `continuation_kind` are current routing semantics
- authored UI/application events use `external_events[]` and
  top-level `target`; see [App Events](../../sdk/bundle/bundle-events-README.md)
- `turn_id` on the request is a client correlation hint; the server allocates or confirms the authoritative task/turn id in the acknowledgement
- for continuations, `target_turn_id` is the user/client intent and `active_turn_id` is the client's best known active turn; neither field is authoritative without server state
- attachments are represented as `event.user.attachment.*` entries in
  `external_events[]`; multipart carries only the corresponding bytes

### Attachments on SSE

For `POST /sse/chat` with attachments, the request is multipart:

- form field `event_submission`
  - JSON string containing the event submission with `external_events[]`
- repeated `files`
  - binary attachment bodies, in the same order as `event.user.attachment.*`
    events

Without attachments, `POST /sse/chat` may be plain JSON.

### Attachments on Socket.IO

For Socket.IO `chat_message`, the first argument is the event submission:

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "optional-existing-conversation-id",
  "external_events": [
    {
      "type": "event.user.attachment.file",
      "event_source_id": "chat.attachment",
      "payload": {
        "mime": "text/plain",
        "event": { "filename": "a.txt", "file_index": 0 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This object is passed directly to `chat_message`; it is not wrapped under
`message`.

Binary attachment buffers are sent as additional event arguments in event order.

### Synchronous acknowledgement

Both send paths return an immediate acknowledgement before the turn necessarily starts.

Known `status` values:

| `status` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `processing_started` | A regular turn was admitted to the normal proc ready queue. |
| `followup_accepted` | The conversation was busy; the message was accepted into the shared external event source as a followup. |
| `steer_accepted` | The conversation was busy; the message was accepted into the shared external event source as a steer/control event. |

Continuation acknowledgements may include these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `turn_id` | Server-side task/turn id for the submitted request. For accepted continuations this is the fallback queued turn id if the live owner does not consume the event. |
| `active_turn_id` | Server-observed active turn at ingress time. Prefer this for immediate same-turn UI rendering. |
| `target_turn_id` | Client/user intended turn. This is advisory metadata and can be stale. |
| `queued_turn_id` | Explicit alias for the fallback queued turn id carried in `turn_id`. |
| `event_id` | Durable external event id in the conversation event source. Use it as the best dedupe key for optimistic continuation bubbles. |
| `external_event_sequence` | Ordered sequence in the per-conversation external event source. |
| `live_owner_detected` | `true` when ingress saw a live owner lease for `active_turn_id`; `false` means the event was stored but should not be rendered as already consumed by the live turn. |

Client rules:

- send `followup` / `steer` intent and optionally send `target_turn_id`
- treat `followup_accepted` / `steer_accepted` as admission only
- do not create a new visible turn on `followup_accepted` / `steer_accepted`
- for an immediate optimistic followup bubble, require `live_owner_detected !== false`, attach it to `active_turn_id || target_turn_id`, and dedupe with `event_id || queued_turn_id || turn_id`
- if the live owner closes before consumption, wait for the later `chat_start`; proc will promote the stored event once as a normal turn

Use:

- [Chat Stream Events](../../sdk/solutions/chat/chat-stream-events-README.md)

for the event semantics after acceptance.

Important stream routes after acceptance:

| Route | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `chat_start` | Turn began processing. |
| `chat_step` | Structured progress, decisions, tool updates, custom app events. |
| `chat_delta` | Streaming answer/thinking/artifact chunks. |
| `chat_compaction` | ReAct context compaction started/completed/skipped during a long turn. |
| `chat_complete` | Final answer and followups. |
| `chat_error` | Turn failed. |
| `chat_service` | Gateway, queue, and rate-limit events. |
| `conv_status` | Conversation state snapshot. |

## 9. Integrations And App REST Calls

This is the relevant contract for:

- app widgets
- custom app frontends
- any client calling `/api/integrations/*`

### Auth on integrations REST

The integrations layer accepts the same auth/timezone context as normal HTTP requests:

- `Authorization`
- configured ID token header
- configured timezone header
- configured UTC offset header
- cookies as fallback

For browser/widget cases where setting headers is inconvenient, the middleware also accepts these query params on `/api/integrations/*` and injects them into headers before gateway processing:

| Query param | Injected header |
| --- | --- |
| `bearer_token` | `Authorization: Bearer ...` |
| `id_token` | configured ID token header |
| `user_timezone` | configured timezone header |
| `user_utc_offset_min` | configured UTC offset header |

### Peer-targeted communicator delivery from REST

If the client wants a REST-triggered app operation to emit events back to one
exact already-connected peer, it must send the configured stream-id header:

```http
KDC-Stream-ID: <connected-peer-stream-id>
```

Here, `KDC-Stream-ID` means the request header whose default name is `KDC-Stream-ID` and whose value is the identifier of the already-connected SSE or Socket.IO peer.

Behavior:

- header present:
  server maps it into communicator target peer id, so app-side emits can target that one connected client
- header absent:
  communicator emits remain session-scoped broadcast

Session-scoped broadcast means:

- all connected peers on that session receive the event
- if no peer is listening for that session, nobody receives it

### Non-chat app events over the shared stream

The SSE and Socket.IO streams are not limited to chat turns. An app UI can
reuse the same authenticated stream for peer-to-peer or session-broadcast
events from an app operation, widget call, MCP route, or background-triggered
app code as long as the call is executed with a bound communicator context.

Use this shape when the UI does **not** want to start a chat turn but still
wants live events from app code.

Client-side SSE:

```ts
const streamId = crypto.randomUUID();

const streamUrl = new URL(`${baseUrl}/sse/stream`);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("user_session_id", sessionId);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("stream_id", streamId);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("tenant", tenant);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("project", project);

const events = new EventSource(streamUrl.toString(), { withCredentials: true });

events.addEventListener("ready", event => {
  console.log("stream ready", JSON.parse(event.data));
});

events.addEventListener("chat_service", event => {
  const envelope = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (envelope.type === "app.job.progress") {
    renderProgress(envelope.data);
  }
});
```

Client-side Socket.IO:

```ts
const socket = io(baseUrl, {
  path: "/socket.io",
  auth: {
    user_session_id: sessionId,
    tenant,
    project,
    bearer_token: accessToken,
    id_token: idToken,
  },
});

socket.on("chat_service", envelope => {
  if (envelope.type === "app.job.progress") {
    renderProgress(envelope.data);
  }
});
```

Then call the app operation. For a direct reply to the current browser peer,
send the connected peer id as `KDC-Stream-ID`:

```ts
await fetch(
  `${baseUrl}/api/integrations/bundles/${tenant}/${project}/${bundleId}/operations/run_job`,
  {
    method: "POST",
    credentials: "include",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "KDC-Stream-ID": streamId, // for Socket.IO use socket.id
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ data: { job_id: "job-1" } }),
  },
);
```

App-side operation:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import get_current_comm
from kdcube_ai_app.infra.plugin.bundle_loader import api

@api(alias="run_job", route="operations", user_types=("registered",))
async def run_job(self, job_id: str, **kwargs):
    comm = get_current_comm()

    if comm is not None:
        await comm.service_event(
            type="app.job.progress",
            step="job",
            status="running",
            title="Job running",
            data={"job_id": job_id, "pct": 25},
            broadcast=False,
        )

    # Do the work here.

    if comm is not None:
        await comm.service_event(
            type="app.job.completed",
            step="job",
            status="completed",
            title="Job completed",
            data={"job_id": job_id},
            broadcast=True,
        )

    return {"ok": True, "job_id": job_id}
```

Delivery semantics:

- `broadcast=False` targets the peer from `KDC-Stream-ID` when it was provided;
  otherwise it falls back to the current session route.
- `broadcast=True` sends to all connected SSE/Socket.IO peers in the same
  authenticated session.
- use namespaced semantic event types such as `app.job.progress`,
  `memory.snapshot.completed`, or `admin.import.failed`.

### Tenant/project SSE broadcast

When an app needs to update all connected SSE clients in the same
tenant/project, use `comm.project_event(...)`. This is a separate primitive from
`broadcast=True`:

- `broadcast=True` means all peers in the current user session.
- `comm.project_event(...)` means all SSE clients that explicitly subscribed to
  tenant/project events for the same tenant/project.

Client-side SSE opt-in:

```ts
const streamId = crypto.randomUUID();

const streamUrl = new URL(`${baseUrl}/sse/stream`);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("user_session_id", sessionId);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("stream_id", streamId);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("tenant", tenant);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("project", project);
streamUrl.searchParams.set("project_events", "true");

const events = new EventSource(streamUrl.toString(), { withCredentials: true });

events.addEventListener("chat_service", event => {
  const envelope = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (envelope.type === "my.app.snapshot") {
    applySnapshot(envelope.data);
  }
});
```

App-side publisher:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import get_current_comm

async def publish_snapshot(self, snapshot: dict):
    comm = get_current_comm() or self.comm
    if comm is None:
        return

    await comm.project_event(
        type="my.app.snapshot",
        step="snapshot",
        status="completed",
        title="Snapshot updated",
        data={"snapshot": snapshot},
        auto_markdown=False,
    )
```

Rules:

- project events currently target SSE clients, not Socket.IO clients
- clients must opt in with `project_events=true`
- the event is carried on the existing `chat_service` route; route by
  `envelope.type`
- payloads must be compact, bounded, and already safe for all viewers in the
  tenant/project
- do not publish raw telemetry events, logs, prompts, answers, or unbounded
  result lists through this path
- debounce project broadcasts when the source changes frequently

## 10. Response Headers Clients Should Use

| Header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `X-User-Type` | Resolved user type for the request |
| `X-Session-ID` | Server session id for the request |
| `Retry-After` | Retry hint on `429` and some `503` responses |

Clients should:

- keep `X-Session-ID` stable when they intend to reuse the same session
- honor `Retry-After` when rate-limited or backpressured

## 11. Supported Streaming Payload Patterns

The transport is generic, but there are a few payload styles the platform
already understands and renders consistently.

`delta.marker` is an open string. The markers below are built in; custom
markers are allowed but need explicit client support.

### A) Main answer / thinking text

Use `chat.delta` with marker `answer` or `thinking`.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "chat.delta",
  "delta": {
    "text": "Here is the answer.",
    "index": 0,
    "marker": "answer"
  }
}
```

### B) Structured subsystem payloads

Use `chat.delta` with marker `subsystem` when the client should route the
payload to a specialized widget/tool panel.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "chat.delta",
  "delta": {
    "text": "{\"status\":\"running\",\"progress\":42}",
    "index": 0,
    "marker": "subsystem"
  },
  "extra": {
    "sub_type": "code_exec.status",
    "format": "json",
    "artifact_name": "code_exec.status"
  }
}
```

### C) Canvas-style artifact stream

Use `chat.delta` with marker `canvas` for inline artifact/canvas content such as
HTML, JSON, or managed structured payloads.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "chat.delta",
  "delta": {
    "text": "{\"type\":\"chart\",\"data\":{\"points\":[1,2,3]}}",
    "index": 0,
    "marker": "canvas"
  },
  "extra": {
    "format": "json",
    "artifact_name": "canvas.chart.v1",
    "title": "Chart"
  }
}
```

Hosted files use the `chat.files` event family rather than canvas chunks.
Those files may be produced by built-in rendering tools, strict custom tool
results (`ret.artifact_type: "files"`), or trusted catalog tools that call
`bundle_tool_context.host_files(...)`.

For tool-side hosting, `host_files(...)` must run in a prepared tool context
with tenant, project, user id, conversation id, turn id, conversation storage,
and a hosting-capable `ToolSubsystem`. That context is prepared by
`BaseWorkflow.build_react(...)` in normal flows and `bootstrap_bind_all(...)` in
isolated execution.

### D) Compact timeline text

Use `chat.delta` with marker `timeline_text` for short human-readable entries.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "chat.delta",
  "delta": {
    "text": "Loaded 3 prior turns",
    "index": 0,
    "marker": "timeline_text"
  }
}
```

### E) Custom typed events

If the app wants a custom non-delta semantic event, it can emit a typed
event that still travels over the standard streaming transport.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "app.preferences.updated",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-01T10:00:00Z",
  "event": {
    "agent": "preferences",
    "step": "preferences.updated",
    "status": "completed",
    "title": "Preferences updated"
  },
  "data": {
    "keys": ["city", "diet"]
  }
}
```

Client rule:

- built-in markers and event families are rendered by platform clients
- custom markers or custom event types are allowed, but a client must
  explicitly support them to do anything more than generic display/logging

## 12. Typical Browser Patterns

### Standard app

1. open SSE with `stream_id`
2. send chat via `POST /sse/chat`
3. receive streamed events on that stream

### Standard app with Socket.IO

1. connect Socket.IO with auth payload
2. send chat via `chat_message`
3. receive the same semantic event envelopes on socket events such as:
   - `chat_start`
   - `chat_step`
   - `chat_delta`
   - `chat_complete`

### Widget or custom app frontend

1. get or reuse connected peer id from the host app
2. call `/api/integrations/*`
3. include the configured stream-id header if app-side communicator emits should go only to that peer

### Cookie-based proxylogin deployment

1. browser keeps token cookies
2. requests omit explicit auth headers
3. server falls back to configured auth cookies
