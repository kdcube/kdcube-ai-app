# Auth Selector

The gateway authenticates requests through an authenticator selector stack. The
selector chooses authenticator candidates. The selected authenticator verifies
auth material and returns identity under an authority. Surface guards then
authorize against required authority/grants and return one complete
`UserSession`.

```

There is no special "Telegram role check" in the downstream code. If Telegram
proof is accepted and linked to a platform principal, the resulting session
already carries the effective roles and `identity_authority`.

## Session Is The Boundary

The selector result is a session, not a provider-specific object.

```text
UserSession
  user_id             actor/storage identity
  user_type           effective platform user type
  roles               effective platform roles
  permissions         effective platform permissions
  identity_authority  actor/platform/economics provenance
```

After this point, normal gateway code handles:

- `RequireUser` / `RequireRoles`;
- throttling;
- backpressure;
- economics role/funding;
- app API visibility checks;
- downstream runtime context.

## Why This Exists

KDCube has more than one way a user can arrive:

- browser session with Cognito or bundle-session cookies;
- Telegram Mini App `initData`;
- Telegram webhook signed by a bot;
- Slack request signature;
- app-specific HMAC webhook;
- API key;
- OAuth MCP integration token.

Without an authenticator selector, every app/surface repeats "how do I authenticate this
request, link it to a platform user, and turn that into roles?" The selector
makes that one platform mechanism.

## Connection Hub Candidate

Connection Hub is a selector candidate configured in `assembly.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  authenticators:
    connection_hub:
      enabled: true
      app_id: "connection-hub@1-0"
      operation: "request_authenticate"
```

When enabled, the gateway first accepts a valid platform token/cookie session
when one is present. That path is role-providing and should win. If no platform
session is established, the gateway can ask Connection Hub. Connection Hub
receives a `RequestEnvelope` and dispatches to its own authenticator modules.
Those modules verify proof, read Connection Hub identity links and secrets,
resolve platform authority, and return authority material. The gateway adapter
converts that material into a normal `UserSession`.

The gateway does not call Connection Hub for every anonymous request. A cheap
local prefilter looks for selector hints or recognizable external proof headers
(`X-KDCube-Auth-*`, Telegram initData, provider signatures/API-key headers).
Requests without such material fall through to the normal anonymous session
path without a bundle operation.

Connection Hub stores request-authenticator metadata in its own app store
(Postgres for widget-managed rows) and reads secret values only through bundle
secrets. The gateway sees neither bot tokens nor provider-specific verifier
configuration.

## Controlled Surfaces Carry Selector Hints

For surfaces KDCube controls, request-auth should not depend on guessing. The
surface sends either platform auth material or external proof plus a stable
non-secret authority/authenticator selector:

```http
X-Telegram-Init-Data: <Telegram.WebApp.initData>
X-KDCube-Auth-Authority-ID: telegram.kdcube_ref
X-KDCube-Auth-Authenticator-ID: telegram.kdcube_ref.init_data
```

For provider callbacks where the provider controls the request headers, put the
same selector into the callback URL. Telegram webhooks should be registered as:

```text
/public/telegram_webhook?authenticator_id=telegram.kdcube_ref.webhook
```

The authority/authenticator ids are configured in app props. They name the
non-secret authority realm and verifier row used by the app for this surface or
provider callback. They are not bot ids and not secrets. The Telegram Mini App
host reads them from server config, forwards them to hosted iframes through the
standard `CONFIG_RESPONSE`, and attaches them on its own app API calls.

Uncontrolled third-party hooks are the only place where an authenticator module may
need to infer from raw request shape alone. All new
controlled webhook examples should include `authenticator_id`; the fallback exists
for uncontrolled provider callbacks, not as the preferred setup. If a controlled request supplies
`authenticator_id`, Connection Hub tries that row only and fails closed when no
enabled row matches or the proof is rejected.

## Header-Only Auth Paths

Some platform surfaces intentionally accept only header credentials. MCP and
other machine-to-machine paths use this mode so cookies and request bodies do
not participate in authentication.

```text
header_only_auth=True
  -> skip Connection Hub request-auth bridge
  -> extract Authorization / ID-token headers only
  -> run standard platform token candidate
```

This preserves the existing strict behavior for header-only routes while still
allowing browser, Mini App, webhook, and app API routes to use Connection Hub's
authenticator modules.

## Cognito Is Also An Authenticator

The current Cognito/session/simple auth managers are active through the selector
as the descriptor-registered platform authenticator. They preserve existing
token/cookie behavior but now produce normal selector provenance:

```text
authenticator: kdcube.multi-cognito
  input: Authorization + ID token
  output: identity under kdcube.platform

authenticator: kdcube.bundle-session
  input: kst1 session cookie
  output: identity under kdcube.platform

authenticator family: connection-hub
  input: raw request envelope
  internal authenticator modules: telegram, slack, api-key, oidc, ...
  output: identity under module authority; linker/grant resolver produce session
```

The gateway derives the platform authenticator from
`auth.authenticators.platform` when present, otherwise from existing
`auth.idp`/`auth.providers` descriptors. If no descriptor declares platform
auth, the development default is `simple`. Runtime code should not introduce
new service-local `AUTH_PROVIDER` switches.

## Multiple Bots And Providers

Provider families can have multiple configured authenticator rows. These rows
belong to Connection Hub. The gateway does not know them. For Telegram,
Connection Hub recognizes Telegram request shape and tries its configured
authenticator rows:

```text
request has x-telegram-init-data
  -> gateway calls Connection Hub bridge
  -> Connection Hub module family = telegram
  -> if x-kdcube-auth-authenticator-id=telegram.support.init_data:
       try telegram.support.init_data only
     else:
       use provider fallback order for uncontrolled hooks
  -> selected_authenticator = telegram.support.init_data
```

This is bounded selection, not a blind broadcast to every app in the system.

## Current Limits

Implemented now:

- the authenticator selector contract and SDK primitives;
- descriptor-registered platform token/cookie auth as the role-providing first
  path;
- optional Connection Hub bridge candidate;
- `UserSession.identity_authority`;
- Connection Hub `request_authenticate` operation;
- Connection Hub authenticator metadata widget/API backed by Postgres rows and
  bundle-secret references;
- Redis-backed Connection Hub authenticator metadata selector cache;
- Telegram authenticator module with `initData` verification and identity-link
  authority projection.

Not complete yet:

- Slack/webhook/API-key authenticator modules;
- custom-authority surface guards for non-platform required authorities.
