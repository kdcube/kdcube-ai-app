# Auth Overview

This module supports multiple authentication providers and several token transport
options across REST, SSE, and Socket.IO.

## How auth works (current)

1) **Request-auth selector**
The gateway runs the request through the auth selector. A valid platform
token/cookie session wins first because it directly provides platform authority.
If no platform session is established, the selector can accept the Connection
Hub request-auth bridge. Provider-specific proof modules live inside Connection
Hub.

2) **Authentication**
The selected authenticator returns a complete `UserSession`. For classic
platform requests this is Cognito/session/simple auth. For channel/provider
requests this may be Connection Hub after one of its provider modules verifies
proof and resolves linked authority.

3) **User type classification**  
User type is derived from roles:
- **Privileged**: any role in `PRIVILEGED_ROLES` (`kdcube:role:super-admin`, `kdcube:role:admin`)
- **Paid**: any role in `PAID_ROLES` (`kdcube:role:paid`)
- **Registered**: authenticated user with any other role
- **Anonymous**: no valid token

4) **Requirements enforcement**  
`RequireUser()` now means:
- user is **non‑anonymous**
- user has **at least one role**

5) **Session ownership enforcement**  
If a request includes `User-Session-ID` (header) or `user_session_id` (query param),
the gateway verifies that this session belongs to the authenticated user. Unknown or
mismatched sessions are rejected (401/403).

## Boundary With Connections

Service auth validates platform credentials and produces a `UserSession` for
platform REST/SSE/Socket.IO/MCP/API requests. It should not contain every
provider-specific identity-link rule.

When a request starts from another channel, such as Telegram init data, webhook
signature, API key, or an app-owned proof, KDCube-controlled callers should
send the external proof plus the stable non-secret `integration_id` that names
the app integration row being used. API and iframe calls normally carry it as
`X-KDCube-Auth-Integration-ID`; provider
webhooks that cannot add arbitrary selector headers, such as Telegram
`setWebhook`, should put the same selector in the webhook URL query string:
`?integration_id=<integration-id>`. Uncontrolled hooks may lack that
hint and are handled by provider-specific request-shape matching as a fallback.
Connection Hub should:

1. select the provider module from the request shape;
2. validate the provider/request proof;
3. resolve the provider identity to a linked platform principal through
   Connections;
4. resolve platform roles/permissions for that principal;
5. stamp the execution context before role checks, economics, ReAct, tools, or
   child runtimes run.

Connection Hub authenticator rows store metadata and `secret_ref` only. Provider
secrets remain in descriptor-backed bundle secrets, not in app tables or widget
state.

That authority projection is documented in
[Auth Selector](auth-selector-README.md),
[Connection Hub Solution](../../sdk/solutions/connections/connection-hub-solution-README.md) and
[Cross-Runtime Context](../../runtime/cross-runtime-context-README.md).

## Supported auth providers

1) Cognito (production)
- Implementation: [Cognito auth](../../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/auth/implementations/cognito.py)
- Uses access token (Bearer) and optional ID token for profile/roles.

2) Multi-Cognito (mixed trusted runtimes)
- Implementation: [Multi Cognito auth](../../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/auth/implementations/multi_cognito.py)
- `auth.idp: multi-cognito`.
- Accepts JWTs from every configured `auth.providers` Cognito user-pool/client
  pair. Provider selection is based on token claims: `iss` plus `client_id`
  for access tokens or `aud` for ID tokens.
- The access token and ID token must resolve to the same provider and subject.
- The browser still logs into one configured OIDC provider. Multi-Cognito is a
  server-side trust-list mode for mixed scenes where one authenticated shell can
  call apps hosted by another trusted runtime.

3) SimpleIDP (dev / local)
- Implementation: [SimpleIDP](../../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/middleware/simple_idp.py)
- Token-to-user mapping stored in `idp_users.json` (or `IDP_DB_PATH`).
- Bundle-owned sign-in flows can register users through the cached registry
  utility documented in [Bundle SimpleIDP Bridge](bundle-simple-idp-bridge-README.md).

4) Bundle session auth
- Implementation: [Bundle session auth](../../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/auth/bundle/sessions.py)
- `auth.idp: session`.
- A bundle/front shell validates an external identity and calls the async
  platform session authority to register/login/logout/delete/invalidate users.
- Session cookies carry a signed `kst1.*` token. Redis stores the active
  session record, user record, and revocation/version state.
- Details: [Bundle Session Auth](bundle-session-auth-README.md).

5) Delegated auth (proxy login service)
- Proxy service build: [ProxyLogin Dockerfile](../../../deployment/docker/custom-ui-managed-infra/Dockerfile_ProxyLogin)
- Proxy service wiring: [custom-ui-managed compose](../../../deployment/docker/custom-ui-managed-infra/docker-compose.yaml)
- The proxy service exchanges credentials and returns tokens; the UI stores
  access + refresh + id tokens and forwards them to the API.
- The delegated web-proxy supports both the existing masquerade cookie flow and
  a non-masquerade flow where the real auth and identity cookies are already
  present on the request.

6) OAuth MCP integration access
- Implementation: `kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.ingress.oauth_mcp`.
- KDCube hosts an OAuth2 authorization server and an MCP protected resource for
  external integration clients such as Claude Code.
- Existing platform session auth proves the human admin before consent.
- Consent issues a least-privilege integration session and binds the selected
  MCP tool allowlist to the issued grant.
- Details: [OAuth MCP Integration Access](oauth-mcp-integration-access-README.md).

### Multi-Cognito descriptor shape

The primary `auth.cognito` block remains the provider surfaced to the browser
through `/api/cp-frontend-config`. `auth.providers` is the server-side trust
list used by ingress/proc token verification.

```yaml
auth:
  type: cognito
  idp: multi-cognito
  cognito:
    region: eu-west-1
    user_pool_id: eu-west-1_PRIMARY
    app_client_id: primary-client
    service_client_id: primary-client
  providers:
  - alias: primary
    kind: cognito
    region: eu-west-1
    user_pool_id: eu-west-1_PRIMARY
    app_client_id: primary-client
  - alias: peer
    kind: cognito
    region: eu-west-1
    user_pool_id: eu-west-1_PEER
    app_client_id: peer-client
```

Equivalent JSON can be supplied with `AUTH_COGNITO_PROVIDERS_JSON` or
`COGNITO_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS_JSON`. A provider hint may be transported by future
clients for routing/logging, but token claims remain authoritative.

| Goal | Read |
|---|---|
| Understand how requests choose Cognito/session/Connection Hub authenticators | [Auth Selector](auth-selector-README.md) |
| Bundle/front shell performs login and browser should become a platform user | [Bundle Session Auth](bundle-session-auth-README.md) |
| Bundle writes a SimpleIDP token for local/embedded simple auth | [Bundle SimpleIDP Bridge](bundle-simple-idp-bridge-README.md) |
| External tool should access a narrow MCP integration surface after admin consent | [OAuth MCP Integration Access](oauth-mcp-integration-access-README.md) |
| Public mini app needs Socket.IO Data Bus publish rights | [Bundle Federated Auth](../../sdk/bundle/auth-bundle-federated-README.md) |
| Bundle endpoint should be public or role-protected | [Bundle Firewall](../../sdk/bundle/bundle-firewall-README.md) |

## Token transport (server-side)

The gateway/auth adapters accept tokens from multiple sources. The intent is to
support:
- REST (headers, cookies)
- SSE (query params, headers, cookies)
- Socket.IO (auth payload, cookies)

### Access token (auth)
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Cookie: `__Secure-LATC` (configurable via `AUTH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME`)
- SSE query param: `bearer_token`
- Socket.IO auth payload: `bearer_token`

### ID token
- Header: `X-ID-Token` (configurable via `ID_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME`)
- Cookie: `__Secure-LITC` (configurable via `ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME`)
- SSE query param: `id_token`
- Socket.IO auth payload: `id_token`

### Precedence
1) Explicit transport payload (headers or auth payload for Socket.IO)
2) Query params (SSE only)
3) Cookies (fallback)

Notes:
- For SSE, query param tokens are injected into headers in
  [chat web app](../../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/ingress/web_app.py) before gateway processing.
- For Socket.IO, the gateway session upgrade uses auth payload first, then cookies
  in [ingress chat core](../../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/ingress/chat_core.py).
- If cookies are present, they are treated as valid credentials (same as headers).

## Delegated proxy cookie flows

Delegated auth has two proxy-level request shapes:

| Shape | Browser request contains | Proxy action |
|---|---|---|
| Masquerade cookie flow | proxylogin masquerade cookie only | call internal `/auth/unmask`, receive real token cookies, inject them into the upstream request |
| Non-masquerade cookie flow | configured auth cookie and configured ID cookie | forward the request with those cookies unchanged |

The current web-proxy templates include a commented future validation hook in
the non-masquerade branch:

```nginx
# local validation = ngx.location.capture("/auth/validate", {
#     method = ngx.HTTP_GET,
# })
```

Leave this call disabled until proxylogin exposes the validation endpoint. The
gateway/backend still validates the resulting JWTs through the configured auth
provider; the future proxylogin validation hook is an extra proxy-side gate for
non-masquerade browser cookie sessions.

## Configuration

Common environment variables:
- `ID_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME` (default `X-ID-Token`)
- `AUTH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` (default `__Secure-LATC`)
- `ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` (default `__Secure-LITC`)
- `IDP_DB_PATH` (SimpleIDP user token map)
- `services.session_token.secret` (descriptor secret used by bundle session auth)

In descriptor-driven deployments these values come from `assembly.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  idp: "simple" # simple | cognito | session
  id_token_header_name: "X-ID-Token"
  auth_token_cookie_name: "__Secure-LATC"
  id_token_cookie_name: "__Secure-LITC"
  jwks_cache_ttl_seconds: 86400
```

## Roles (current)

Common role names in this codebase (non‑exhaustive):
- `kdcube:role:super-admin` → privileged
- `kdcube:role:admin` → privileged
- `kdcube:role:paid` → paid
- `kdcube:role:chat-user` → registered
- `kdcube:role:service` → service accounts (registered unless explicitly privileged)

Role sets are defined in `kdcube_ai_app/auth/AuthManager.py`.
