# Control Plane Web App

The KDCube control-plane web app is the browser shell for selecting and using
apps in one tenant/project deployment. It presents each app's browser surfaces,
hosts platform control panels, and connects chat UI to backend transports.

It is not a mandatory frontend framework for every app. An app may provide its
own main view, widgets, Scene, complete website, or no browser surface.

## Browser Journey

```text
load browser shell
      |
      v
GET /api/cp-frontend-config
      |
      +-- tenant/project and app catalog
      +-- provider-neutral auth contract
      +-- cookie/header and platform-route configuration
      `-- browser feature/configuration values
      |
      v
GET /profile
      |
      +-- authenticated platform user -> continue
      `-- anonymous -> follow configured login route
      |
      v
select app
      |
      +-- app main view exists -> show it
      `-- otherwise -> show automatic app scene
```

`/api/cp-frontend-config` is the effective browser configuration contract.
The client must not reconstruct provider, app, tenant, project, or cookie
configuration from internal URLs or deployment assumptions.

`/profile` is the source of logged-in state. A visible email, local OIDC cache,
or client-readable cookie is not sufficient evidence of an authenticated
platform user.

## Provider-Neutral Authentication

The backend can select Cognito, multi-Cognito, SimpleIDP, or an
application-hosted authority provider. The browser consumes the resolved auth
contract rather than branching on provider internals.

For application-hosted auth, the frontend config may carry a concrete login URL
or a Connection Hub authority/provider reference. When the URL is absent, the
web app asks Connection Hub to resolve the configured provider entrypoint.

Connection Hub remains the authority/provider registry and policy owner even
when another app hosts login, session-issue, or consent presentation.

## App Presentation

The selected app controls what it provides. The control-plane web app follows
this presentation order:

```text
app provides built ui.main_view
  -> iframe the app's main view
  -> retain visible widget chips/panels as companion surfaces

app has no main view
  -> build the automatic app scene from visible widgets
  -> first widget opens on arrival
  -> reserved chat widget opens first when declared

app has no browser surfaces
  -> show an honest background-app empty state
```

An app declares the ready chat surface with:

```yaml
config:
  surfaces:
    as_provider:
      bundle:
        default_chat: true
```

This serves the SDK chat widget under the reserved alias `chat`. It is an
explicit intent declaration. An inherited `@on_reactive_event` handler only
proves runtime capability; it does not imply that the app wants chat UI.

## Provider And Consumer Roles

The web app presents provider surfaces exposed by selected apps. App
dependencies remain a separate consumer concern:

```text
surfaces.as_provider
  what the control plane may discover and present/call for this app

surfaces.as_consumer
  what the app, its agents, and its composed Scene may call or mount
```

For example, a Scene component entry is consumer wiring because the Scene app
mounts another app's widget. The mounted widget's own serving route remains its
provider app identity; the host does not rewrite that identity to itself.

## Quick-Access Rail

The side rail is the home for platform control surfaces. Depending on what the
deployment serves and the current user's visibility, it can open:

- economics and usage;
- app controls;
- gateway state;
- conversation browser;
- Redis browser;
- the services app's storage browser;
- the pinned connections widget;
- selected app widget panels while an app main view is active.

Conversation UX and conversation controls belong inside the chat widget rather
than the platform rail.

## Chat And Surface Communication

The chat component owns conversation streaming, attachments, files, tool
progress, followups, steer, model/capability settings, and connection actions.
The shell supplies the selected app/tenant/project context and maintains the
backend connection.

Cross-surface actions use declared surface commands. A command such as opening
connections follows an acknowledgement contract; the sender can use a direct
served-widget fallback when no host acknowledges it. A row that cannot perform
either route should not render as a silent no-op.

Context drag/drop preserves object kind and ref. In particular,
`conv:fi:...` is a conversation-owned file/context object, not a conversation
id. Only a strict `conv:<conversation_id>` ref enters conversation loading.

## Application Websites Are Separate

The control-plane app surface and an application-hosted website use the same app
UI build/storage lifecycle but different browser routes:

```text
control-plane app view
  selected inside the KDCube shell

application-hosted site
  complete built main-view tree served by alias or host
  resolved through ApplicationSiteCatalog
```

A CDN may preserve the viewer hostname and rewrite a clean public path to the
reserved `site-root` origin route. The CDN does not own the site catalog.

`@public_content` is another separate mechanism for indexed public records,
catalogs, structured metadata, and sitemaps.

## Source And Development

Source package:

```text
app/ai-app/ui/chat-web-app
```

Key implementation areas:

```text
src/BuildConfig.ts                     runtime endpoint and local fallback
src/features/auth/                     browser auth behavior
src/features/bundles/AppScene.tsx      automatic app scene
src/components/chat/Chat.tsx           main-view versus scene selection
src/features/chatSidePanel/            quick-access rail and panels
src/features/chatController/           SSE/Socket.IO connection behavior
```

Local commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The Vite development server proxies platform API, integration, profile,
monitoring, Socket.IO, and SSE routes to configured local backends.

## Do Not Infer

- The control-plane web app is not required for a standalone app website.
- Selecting an app does not make all of its surfaces visible; provider policy
  and current authority still apply.
- Consumer tool/MCP/named-service configuration is not a browser publication
  mechanism.
- A main view does not remove the app's widget chips and side panels.
- A session id alone is not the server-side relay routing key; relay state is
  tenant/project/session scoped.
- Browser auth state is not authority for backend operations; every request is
  authenticated and authorized again by the serving runtime.
