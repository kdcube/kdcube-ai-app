# Proc Design Notes

This directory contains **forward-looking processor design notes**.

The current source-of-truth for the shipped processor remains:

- [processor-arch-README.md](../processor-arch-README.md)
- [longrun-protection-README.md](../longrun-protection-README.md)

Current design notes:

- [../events-orchestration-README.md](../events-orchestration-README.md)
  The current processor event-orchestration map for lane-backed external events,
  ready-queue wakeups, processor payload resolution, and the boundary with ReAct
  timeline folding.

- [conversation-scheduler-streams-README.md](conversation-scheduler-streams-README.md)
  The proposed migration from the current global Lists-based proc queue to a
  conversation-oriented scheduler built around Redis Streams, leases, and
  owner-loop execution, with an explicit Kafka mapping for the same scheduler
  semantics if we later want Kafka as the transport backend.
