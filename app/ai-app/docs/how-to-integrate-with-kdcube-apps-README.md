# How To Integrate With KDCube Apps

Use this page first when an external website, product client, server, or
KDCube-hosted UI needs to integrate with a KDCube app.

A KDCube app is not only a widget. An app can expose backend surfaces without
shipping any UI, and a host product can either iframe KDCube-served UI or build
its own native UI that talks to KDCube app surfaces directly.

Implementation note: many lower-level SDK docs and runtime routes still use
the older term `bundle` for the deployable app package. This article uses
`app` for the product-facing concept and links to those lower-level contracts.

## Integration Modes

| Mode | UI owner | Backend owner | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KDCube-served app UI in an iframe | KDCube app | KDCube app | The host wants to embed the app's widget or main view as a contained UI. |
| Embedded KDCube control plane | KDCube | KDCube + selected apps | The host wants the full KDCube chat/control-plane experience inside its product. |
| Direct host browser client | Host product | KDCube app surfaces | The host wants native UI while KDCube owns chat, agents, objects, files, or app state. |
| Host server/backend client | Host server | KDCube app surfaces | A server job, webhook handler, CRM pipeline, or product backend calls KDCube without a browser widget. |
| Backend-only app consumption | Host browser or server | KDCube app backend only | The app exposes operations, Data Bus handlers, named services, MCP, jobs, or agents, but no UI. |

These modes can be combined. A product can iframe one KDCube app UI, call
another app backend directly, and send conversation events to an agent in the
same deployment.

## Mode 1: Iframe A KDCube App UI

The host page owns the outer page and decides where the iframe lives. KDCube
serves the app UI document and the app owns the UI source.

```text
Host.Client owns:
  Host.page
  Host.iframe_container
  optional Host.tokens

KDCube owns:
  KDCube.app_ui_url
  KDCube.frame_headers
  KDCube.runtime_config
  KDCube.session_stream

KDCube.App owns:
  App.UI.source
  App.Operation.aliases
  App.DataBus.handlers
  App.domain_state

Host.Client
  -> iframe src=KDCube.app_ui_url
  -> CONFIG_RESPONSE {Host.tokens?, tenant, project, app_id}

App.UI
  -> /api/integrations/.../operations/{alias}
  -> Socket.IO data_bus.publish or POST /sse/data_bus.publish
  -> /sse/stream or Socket.IO for service events
```

Use this shape when the host wants to reuse a KDCube app UI with minimal
host-side frontend code.

App UI responsibilities:

- declare the UI surface
- configure the matching source-folder build when the UI is a built app
- obtain runtime config from `GET /api/cp-frontend-config` or the parent
  `CONFIG_REQUEST` / `CONFIG_RESPONSE` handshake
- call KDCube through the UI frame/runtime origin, not the outer host page
  origin
- use app operations for direct commands
- use Data Bus for durable app-owned mutations
- include the stream/peer id when an operation response should target the same
  connected browser peer

Host responsibilities:

- choose same-origin, same-site subdomain, or cross-site embedding topology
- configure frame policy, CORS only when the host page itself fetches KDCube,
  and cookie/token handoff
- validate iframe `postMessage` origins
- render, resize, focus, or promote the iframe without assuming access to its
  cross-origin DOM

- [Embedding The Control Plane Frontend](service/cicd/embedding-control-plane-frontend-README.md)
- [Bundle Widget Integration](sdk/bundle/bundle-widget-integration-README.md)
- [UI Components Lifecycle](sdk/bundle/ui-components-lifecycle-README.md)

## Mode 2: Direct Host Browser Client

The host product owns the UI. It calls KDCube routes directly and renders the
results in native host components.

```text
Host.Client owns:
  Host.UI
  Host.auth_session or token handoff
  Host.stream_id
  Host.local_view_state

KDCube owns:
  KDCube.gateway_routes
  KDCube.chat_stream
  KDCube.conversation_event_bus
  KDCube.data_bus_ingress

KDCube.App owns:
  App.operations
  App.DataBus.handlers
  App.named_service_provider?
  App.domain_state

Host.Client
  -> GET /sse/stream or Socket.IO connect
  -> POST /sse/chat or Socket.IO chat_message
  -> POST /api/integrations/.../operations/{alias}
  -> data_bus.publish
  <- chat_* / chat_service / conv_status events
```

Use this shape for a custom website or application scene that should feel
native to the host product while KDCube provides chat, agents, streams, app
operations, Data Bus, or named-service object access.

Host-browser responsibilities:

- own the product UI and interaction model
- choose SSE or Socket.IO and preserve the stream/session identity
- send auth through headers, query params where required by SSE, or cookies
- treat chat send acknowledgements as admission, not final results
- subscribe to the shared chat stream event catalog
- use conversation `external_events[]` only when the user action should become
  conversation context for a turn
- use Data Bus when the user action mutates app-owned domain state
- call app operations for direct request/response backend commands
- respect tenant, project, app id, user, and auth context exactly as runtime
  config provides them

- [Conversation Event Bus And Data Bus](service/comm/conversation-event-bus-and-data-bus-README.md)
- [Data Bus](service/comm/data-bus-README.md)

## Mode 3: Host Server Or Backend Client

The host server calls KDCube as part of a backend workflow, webhook handler,
scheduled job, CRM/event pipeline, or product service. There may be no browser
client involved.

```text
Host.Server owns:
  Host.upstream_event
  Host.service_identity
  Host.idempotency_key
  Host.retry_policy

KDCube owns:
  KDCube.authz_context
  KDCube.app_invocation
  KDCube.data_bus_ingress
  KDCube.chat_enqueue

KDCube.App owns:
  App.backend_contract
  App.domain_state
  App.named_service_provider?

Host.Server
  -> App.Operation or public API
  -> Data Bus message {subject, object_ref, payload, idempotency_key}
  -> chat send path with external_events[] when an agent turn should see it
  <- operation response, stream/service event, or later domain state read
```

Use this shape when a server-side workflow integrates with a KDCube app backend,
not with a user-facing iframe.

Server responsibilities:

- carry the correct service/user authorization context
- keep idempotency keys for durable mutations
- distinguish admission responses from domain completion
- map upstream provider events into either Data Bus messages or conversation
  events based on ownership
- avoid bypassing app-owned domain storage by writing directly into storage
  internals
- expose only the host-side secrets needed by the host server; app secrets
  remain app-scoped

## Backend-Only App Integration

A KDCube app can be useful without a widget or main view.

Backend-only apps may expose:

- operations or public APIs
- Data Bus handlers
- named-service providers
- MCP endpoints
- scheduled jobs
- chat/on-message agents
- file or artifact hosting behavior

They do not need app UI configuration unless they ship a KDCube-served
frontend. A direct host browser client or host server can consume the backend
surfaces exactly the same way a KDCube-served UI would.

Backend-only authoring checklist:

- document the operation aliases, public APIs, Data Bus subjects,
  named-service namespaces, and auth model in the app interface
- configure gateway/Data Bus limits if browser or server clients publish
  durable messages
- decide whether user actions should enter the Conversation Event Bus, Data
  Bus, or a direct operation
- test discovery and invocation through the real runtime, not only local helper
  calls

## Choosing Event Bus, Data Bus, Or Operation

| User/client intent | Use | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Tell the agent about this and let it react." | Conversation Event Bus via `/sse/chat` or Socket.IO `chat_message` with `external_events[]` | The event becomes ordered conversation context. |
| "Mutate durable app-owned state." | Data Bus | App handler owns ordering, idempotency, retries, and state mutation. |
| "Run a direct command and return a response now." | App operation/public API | Request/response command, usually from app UI or host UI. |
| "Read or act on namespace-owned objects." | Named service provider/client contract | Namespace owner defines refs, schemas, actions, files, and resolver behavior. |
| "Show an existing KDCube UI." | Iframe app UI/control plane | Reuse KDCube-served frontend. |

## Auth And Origin Decision

Browser integrations must decide two separate things:

1. Can the host page frame KDCube?
2. Can the browser or iframe carry auth to KDCube?

Server integrations instead decide which service/user auth context the server
is allowed to carry.

```text
Browser iframe:
  Host.Client.frame_policy -> proxy.frame_embedding
  Host.Client.auth_transport -> cookie or CONFIG_RESPONSE token handoff

Direct browser fetch:
  Host.Client.fetch_origin -> cors.allow_origins
  Host.Client.auth_transport -> headers, SSE query params, or cookies

Server call:
  Host.Server.identity -> service/user authorization context
  Host.Server.network -> backend route/auth policy
```

For preview pages, do not add each PR hostname as a separate origin. Configure
the provider deployment with a wildcard origin such as
`https://*.preview.example.com` in `cors.allow_origins`; the runtime treats
descriptor origins containing `*` as CORS origin patterns. This matters for
host-page calls such as `GET /api/cp-frontend-config`. It is separate from
iframe permission, which is controlled by `proxy.frame_embedding`.

Embedding and direct browser fetch are related but different. A CORS allowlist
does not allow iframe embedding, and frame policy does not allow the outer host
page to fetch KDCube.

## Minimum Client Checklists

### Iframe App UI

- route loads from KDCube app UI URL
- frame headers allow the host page
- auth works after iframe reload
- runtime config contains base URL, tenant, project, app id, and auth
- operations use KDCube origin
- durable mutations use Data Bus where appropriate
- stream events render admission, progress, completion, and errors

### Direct Host Browser Client

- opens `/sse/stream` or Socket.IO with stable stream/session identity
- sends `/sse/chat` or `chat_message` with the correct tenant/project/app
  context
- handles `followup_accepted` and `steer_accepted` as admission only
- handles all known chat stream events and treats unknown semantic event types
  as generic visible service/progress events
- uses Data Bus for domain mutations
- uses operations for request/response backend commands
- does not assume widget-only config handshakes exist

### Host Server Client

- carries authorized service/user context
- uses idempotency keys for durable messages
- distinguishes operation completion from Data Bus handler completion
- records enough upstream ids to replay safely
- never writes app-owned domain state behind the app provider/handler
