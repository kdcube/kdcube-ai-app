# Agent Harness Runtime

The agent harness is the framework-neutral runtime layer between KDCube's
classical runtime services and concrete agent implementations.

                                      (for example LangGraph)
```

ReAct is a consumer of this layer, not its owner. Conversation APIs, chat and
canvas integrations, and ported agents also use parts of the same contracts.
This prevents every agent framework from inventing a different ref grammar,
turn-log format, artifact layout, or file-download resolver.

## Scope Map

| Scope | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Events](events/README.md) | Canonical event/object-ref resolution and byte/action dispatch for shared refs. | Event Bus scheduling, framework decisions, or namespace-provider policy. |
| [Timeline](timeline/README.md) | Block identity, persisted timeline payloads, turn logs, client turn views, and provider-owned render projection. | ReAct rounds, prompt compaction, model protocol, or strategic governance. |
| [Workspace](workspace/README.md) | Conversation ref grammar, distributed turn paths, artifact records, change detection, and byte materialization. | A framework's model-facing tool names or decision policy. |

The scopes deliberately remain separate. A file can exist in the workspace
without being a timeline artifact. A timeline block can reference an object
whose bytes are resolved by the events scope. The umbrella package therefore
does not flatten all APIs into one namespace.

## Shared Contract Versus Adapter Policy

The harness defines stable data and runtime boundaries:

- conversation-owned refs use `conv:<family>:` and carry
  `conv_<conversation_id>` as the owner segment inside the ref body;
- persisted timelines and turn logs are ordered block streams;
- a client turn view is reconstructed from persisted blocks rather than from
  framework-private in-memory state;
- workspace paths are `OUTPUT_DIR`-relative and use `git/projects/`,
  `files/`, `git/snapshots/`, `attachments/`, and `external/` by meaning;
- ref strings are locators, while tenant/project/user/authority come from the
  trusted runtime context;
- byte resolution and materialization happen in trusted runtime code.

An adapter decides how to use those contracts:

| Adapter concern | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Model protocol | ReAct channels and actions; a ported graph's own state transitions. |
| Scheduling semantics | ReAct can fold eligible events during a live turn; a run-to-completion graph may consume a batch only at turn start. |
| Model tools | `react.pull`, `react.read`, and `react.checkout` are ReAct-facing tools over shared workspace/resolver primitives. |
| Prompt projection | ReAct ANNOUNCE, compaction, context cache, and round layout remain ReAct-owned. |
| Tool/result rendering | The common timeline projection validates provider-owned patches; each adapter decides when to invoke it and how to expose the result. |

Do not document a framework policy as a harness guarantee merely because its
implementation imports a harness helper.

## Current Consumers

| Consumer | Shared harness use |
| --- | --- |
| ReAct v2/v3 | All three scopes, plus ReAct-owned rounds, tools, prompts, cache, and online governance. |
| Ported LangGraph example | Turn workspace materialization, canonical file refs, byte resolution, and the common code-exec artifact layout. |
| Conversation solution | Timeline payload parsing, turn-log persistence, turn-view reconstruction, and canonical ref presentation. |
| Chat/canvas surfaces | Canonical `conv:fi:` refs and generic object download/action resolution. |
| Namespace providers | Owner refs can be materialized through registered rehosters without teaching the harness each provider's storage layout. |

## Implementation Map

```text
kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/runtime/harness/
  events/
    resolver.py
  timeline/
    identity.py
    payload.py
    projection.py
    turn_log.py
    turn_view.py
  workspace/
    artifacts.py
    layout.py
    pull.py
    references.py
```

Framework code belongs outside this tree. ReAct-specific implementations live
under `sdk/solutions/react`; the worked ported-agent adapter lives under the
`ported-langgraph-agents@2026-07-13` example app.

## Remaining Source Extraction

The contract boundary is established, but the source extraction is not
complete. Common runtime and non-ReAct callers still import several mixed
modules under `sdk/solutions/react`. Do not move those files wholesale: extract
the shared primitive and leave the ReAct policy in the ReAct adapter.
ReAct-specific terms in this inventory are described in
[ReAct Structure](../../sdk/agents/react/structure-README.md) and
[Round Generation Feedback](../../sdk/agents/react/round-generation-feedback-README.md).

| Current ReAct location | Shared part to extract | Part that stays ReAct-specific |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `solution_workspace.py` | Conversation file hosting, timeline rehosting, and execution-snapshot workspace assembly into `runtime/harness/workspace/`. | ReAct-facing read/pull behavior and ReAct timeline integration. |
| `workspace.py` | Code-path discovery, logical/physical path hydration, and framework-neutral checkout primitives into `runtime/harness/workspace/`. | ReAct tool semantics and ANNOUNCE, the uncached per-round runtime-state block shown to the model. |
| `artifacts.py` and `artifact_analysis.py` | Generic artifact metadata, error normalization, summary preparation, and file materialization. | `ReactArtifactView`, ReAct's artifact presentation model, and ReAct tool-result block layout. |
| `timeline.py` | Artifact lookup, source-pool selectors that choose citation/source blocks, and other block-only readers into `runtime/harness/timeline/`. | The live ReAct `Timeline`, plans, context compaction, memory-reminder blocks, and ANNOUNCE layout. |
| `events/policies/`, `events/exploration.py`, and generic parts of `events/artifact_production.py` | Provider/tool event-source policy, which decides how source output enters the record, and safe block projection into the common event/timeline subsystem. | Native `react.*` event ids, live-listener ownership, bounded extra-round credit for folded events, and ReAct round folding. |
| `proto.py` | A small framework-neutral execution/runtime context under `sdk/runtime/`. | `ReactResult`, `ReactStateSnapshot`, ReAct cache/session policy, and subagent state. |
| `decision_prompt.py` | The wrapper that inserts administrator-owned instructions at their required priority into shared instruction helpers. | ReAct decision protocol and prompt composition. |

Two dependencies need decoupling rather than relocation:

- conversation search should use its common search backend without importing
  the full ReAct `ContextBrowser`;
- generic canvas/file/rendering helpers should use common content, artifact,
  and event-policy utilities instead of importing `react.tools.common` or
  `react.events`.

One worked-adapter activation gap is separate from source extraction:
`ported-langgraph-agents@2026-07-13/platform/code_exec.py` currently creates
its isolated-execution tool subsystem with empty `raw_tool_specs` and
`mcp_tool_specs`. Its `run_python` therefore demonstrates isolated computation
and conversation file hosting, not nested KDCube/MCP tool calls. Enabling the
shared supervisor tool bridge requires the adapter to export its narrowed,
execution-enabled tool specs. The LangGraph-specific wrapper stays in the app;
the runtime tool bridge stays under `sdk/runtime` and `sdk/tools`.

New common runtime, conversation, tool, canvas, or ported-agent code should not
add another `sdk.solutions.react` import. Extract or call the corresponding
harness/runtime primitive instead.

## Reading Order

1. [Events](events/README.md) for ref resolution and ownership.
2. [Timeline](timeline/README.md) for persisted block and client-view contracts.
3. [Workspace](workspace/README.md) for logical refs, paths, and materialization.
4. [ReAct Structure](../../sdk/agents/react/structure-README.md) only when the
   concrete ReAct adapter is relevant.
