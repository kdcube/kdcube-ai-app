# Runtime Configuration and Secrets Store

This page documents the detailed storage and authority model behind runtime
configuration and secret helpers.

Use this page when you need to know:

- which store is authoritative for each data class
- what Redis does and does not own
- what changes in local file mode vs `aws-sm`
- where bundle prop writes persist
- what `kdcube export` can reconstruct

If you are deciding where a value belongs as a bundle author, start with:

- [bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md](bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md)

If you need the helper API contract, use:

- [runtime-read-write-contract-README.md](runtime-read-write-contract-README.md)

## The six data classes

| Data class | Authority today | Runtime cache | Export behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| platform/global props | promoted runtime config assembled from env plus descriptor files such as `assembly.yaml` and `gateway.yaml` | none as a dedicated separate config store | outside bundle export |
| platform/global secrets | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `secrets.yaml` | none as a separate dedicated cache | outside bundle export |
| deployment-scoped bundle props | configured bundle descriptor authority | Redis effective bundle props cache | exported to `bundles.yaml` |
| deployment-scoped bundle secrets | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `bundles.secrets.yaml` | provider-backed lookup; no separate Redis secret store | exported to `bundles.secrets.yaml` only when provider/export flow can reconstruct them |
| user-scoped bundle props | PostgreSQL `<SCHEMA>.user_bundle_props` | no separate Redis authority | never exported |
| user-scoped bundle secrets | configured secrets provider | no separate Redis authority | never exported |

## Mode-specific authority

### CLI local compose

| Data class | Authority |
|---|---|
| platform/runtime non-secret config | staged descriptors under `/config`, plus env |
| deployment-scoped bundle props | mounted `bundles.yaml`, with Redis as runtime cache |
| deployment-scoped bundle secrets | `bundles.secrets.yaml` only when `secrets-file` is active; otherwise configured provider |
| platform/global secrets | `secrets.yaml` only when `secrets-file` is active; otherwise configured provider |
| user props | PostgreSQL |
| user secrets | configured secrets provider |

### Direct local service run

| Data class | Authority |
|---|---|
| platform/runtime non-secret config | files and env passed explicitly to the process |
| deployment-scoped bundle props | mounted or explicitly addressed `bundles.yaml`, with Redis runtime cache if used |
| deployment-scoped bundle secrets | `bundles.secrets.yaml` in `secrets-file` mode, otherwise configured provider |
| platform/global secrets | `secrets.yaml` in `secrets-file` mode, otherwise configured provider |
| user props | PostgreSQL |
| user secrets | configured secrets provider |

### AWS deployment (`aws-sm`)

| Data class | Authority |
|---|---|
| platform/runtime non-secret config | deployment env plus descriptor-backed runtime snapshots |
| deployment-scoped bundle props | configured bundle descriptor authority plus Redis cache; recommended ECS mode is mounted writable `bundles.yaml` on EFS with `BUNDLES_DESCRIPTOR_PROVIDER=file` |
| deployment-scoped bundle secrets | configured secrets provider; for `aws-sm` this is grouped bundle secret state |
| platform/global secrets | configured secrets provider with current grouped/canonical mixed contract where applicable |
| user props | PostgreSQL |
| user secrets | configured secrets provider under user-scoped keys |

Important:

- `SECRETS_PROVIDER` does not have to own deployment-scoped bundle props
- in recommended ECS deployments, keep secrets in AWS SM
- keep deployment-scoped bundle descriptors and non-secret bundle props in
  mounted writable `bundles.yaml`
- set `BUNDLES_DESCRIPTOR_PROVIDER=file`

## Redis role in bundle props

Redis is the runtime cache for effective deployment-scoped bundle props.

The cache key is:

```text
kdcube:config:bundles:props:{tenant}:{project}:{bundle_id}
```

What Redis does:

- serves effective bundle props at runtime
- receives updates from bundle-admin or bundle-code write paths
- publishes bundle-prop update events for proc reconciliation

What Redis does not do:

- it is not the intended long-term authoritative descriptor store
- it is not the export source of truth by itself

If Redis misses:

- file-backed mode backfills from mounted `bundles.yaml`
- `aws-sm` mode backfills from the grouped bundle descriptor authority

## Current write behavior for deployment-scoped bundle props

`set_bundle_prop(...)` is not “write one Redis key and stop”.

Current behavior:

1. write the effective prop update into Redis
2. persist the same change into the configured bundle descriptor authority
3. publish `bundles.props.update` on Redis
4. proc listens to that channel and reconciles scheduler-driven runtime state

That is why `self.bundle_prop(...)` must be treated as effective deployment
config, not as a raw file read.

## Current persistence target for deployment-scoped bundle secrets

`set_bundle_secret(...)` persists into the configured secrets provider.

That means:

- local `secrets-file` mode persists into `bundles.secrets.yaml`
- provider-backed modes persist into the configured provider state

Bundle secrets are not meant to become plain non-secret descriptor data.

## User-scoped state storage

User-scoped bundle state is intentionally outside descriptors.

| Data class | Store |
|---|---|
| user-scoped bundle props | PostgreSQL `<SCHEMA>.user_bundle_props` |
| user-scoped bundle secrets | configured secrets provider |

That is why:

- user state is not exported by `kdcube export`
- user state is not reconstructed into `bundles.yaml`
- user state is not reconstructed into `bundles.secrets.yaml`

If a bundle wants import/export for user-scoped state, the bundle must provide
its own API or operational workflow.

## Current grouped AWS SM layout

For bundle deployment state in `aws-sm`, the grouped documents are:

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| `<prefix>/bundles-meta` | bundle registry inventory |
| `<prefix>/bundles/<bundle_id>/descriptor` | bundle registry entry and non-secret `config` |
| `<prefix>/bundles/<bundle_id>/secrets` | bundle-level secrets only |

Platform/global secret reads may still resolve through grouped documents or
canonical per-key fallback paths depending on the secret class.

So `aws-sm` is not “one single JSON blob for everything”.

## Export and ejection behavior

`kdcube export` is bundle-state export only.

It reconstructs:

- `bundles.yaml`
- `bundles.secrets.yaml`

It does not reconstruct:

- `assembly.yaml`
- `gateway.yaml`
- `secrets.yaml`
- user-scoped bundle props
- user-scoped bundle secrets

The operational interpretation is:

- deployment-scoped bundle state is ejectable back into bundle descriptors
- platform/global deployment state remains deployment-owned
- user-scoped state remains operational state

## Reserved platform-owned bundle props

Reserved bundle prop paths such as:

- `role_models`
- `embedding`
- `economics.reservation_amount_dollars`
- `execution.runtime`
- `mcp.services`

are still stored as deployment-scoped bundle props.

They do not create a new store class.

The special part is interpretation, not storage.

For `execution.runtime`, platform defaults such as ISO runtime file/workspace
limits stay in `assembly.yaml` under `platform.services.proc.exec`; the bundle
prop stores only that bundle's per-run override.

Use the author-facing page for those paths:

- [bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md](../../sdk/bundle/bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md)
