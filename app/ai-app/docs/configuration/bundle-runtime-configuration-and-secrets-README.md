# Bundle Runtime Settings, Configuration, and Secrets

This is the single SDK page bundle authors should use for programmatic access
to settings, props, and secrets.

Use this page when you need to answer questions like:

- which scope does this value belong to
- should this value live in platform/global config, bundle config, or user state
- which helper should read it
- which helper may write it
- where does it actually live at runtime
- what can be exported back out of the system

This page intentionally covers all relevant runtime value classes, not only
bundle-scoped values.

If you need the detailed storage and authority model after that, use:

- [runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md](runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md)

If you need the list of reserved bundle prop paths interpreted by the platform,
use:

- [bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md](../sdk/bundle/bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md)

## The three scopes

There are three scopes bundle authors must reason about:

1. platform/global
2. deployment-scoped bundle
3. user-scoped bundle

Across those scopes, there are six concrete data classes that matter in
practice:

1. platform/global props
2. platform/global secrets
3. deployment-scoped bundle props
4. deployment-scoped bundle secrets
5. user-scoped bundle props
6. user-scoped bundle secrets

Bundle code may read all six classes through the supported helpers.

Normal bundle code should write only:

- deployment-scoped bundle props
- deployment-scoped bundle secrets
- user-scoped bundle props
- user-scoped bundle secrets

Bundle code should not write platform/global props or platform/global secrets.
Those remain deployment-owned.

## Exact scope matrix

| Data class | Read API | Write API from bundle code | Ownership boundary | Live authority today | Export / ejection path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| platform/global props | `get_settings()` for effective values; `get_plain("...")` for raw descriptor inspection | none supported | tenant + project deployment | promoted runtime config assembled from env plus descriptor files such as `assembly.yaml` and `gateway.yaml` | outside `kdcube --export-live-bundles`; manage through deployment descriptors |
| platform/global secrets | `get_secret("canonical.key")` | none supported | tenant + project deployment | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `secrets.yaml` | outside `kdcube --export-live-bundles`; manage through deployment secret workflows |
| deployment-scoped bundle props | `self.bundle_prop(...)`, `self.bundle_props` | `await set_bundle_prop(...)` | tenant + project + bundle | configured bundle descriptor authority; Redis is the runtime cache. Recommended cloud mode is writable mounted `bundles.yaml` with `BUNDLES_DESCRIPTOR_PROVIDER=file`. | exported to `bundles.yaml`; `kdcube --export-live-bundles` includes it |
| deployment-scoped bundle secrets | `get_secret("b:...")` | `await set_bundle_secret(...)` | tenant + project + bundle | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `bundles.secrets.yaml` | exported to `bundles.secrets.yaml` when the provider/export flow can reconstruct them |
| user-scoped bundle props | `get_user_prop(...)`, `get_user_props()` | `set_user_prop(...)`, `delete_user_prop(...)` | tenant + project + bundle + user | PostgreSQL `<SCHEMA>.user_bundle_props` | never exported to descriptors or bundle export |
| user-scoped bundle secrets | `get_user_secret(...)` | `set_user_secret(...)`, `delete_user_secret(...)` | tenant + project + bundle + user | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `secrets.yaml` | never exported to descriptors or bundle export |

## Decide the scope before you write code

| If the value belongs to... | Use | Do not use |
|---|---|---|
| the environment or platform deployment as a whole | `get_settings()` or `get_secret("canonical.key")` | `self.bundle_prop(...)` |
| one bundle for the whole deployment | `self.bundle_prop(...)` or `get_secret("b:...")` | user props or user secrets |
| one user inside one bundle | `get_user_prop(...)` or `get_user_secret(...)` | `bundles.yaml` or `bundles.secrets.yaml` |

Examples:

- OpenAI API key for the deployment -> platform/global secret
- auth client id -> platform/global prop
- bundle feature flag or cron expression -> deployment-scoped bundle prop
- bundle webhook token shared by the deployment -> deployment-scoped bundle secret
- one user's theme preference -> user-scoped bundle prop
- one user's personal GitHub token -> user-scoped bundle secret

## Platform/global props and secrets

These are deployment-owned values, not bundle-owned values.

Use:

- `get_settings()` for effective typed runtime settings
- `get_secret("canonical.key")` for deployment-scoped platform/global secrets
- `get_plain("...")` only when you intentionally need the raw descriptor file

Typical examples:

- ports
- auth type and ids
- storage backend selection
- path roots
- deployment-wide API keys shared by many bundles

Do not store these in:

- `bundles.yaml`
- `bundles.secrets.yaml`
- user props
- user secrets

## Deployment-scoped bundle props and secrets

These values belong to one bundle inside one deployment environment.

Read effective bundle props through:

- `self.bundle_props`
- `self.bundle_prop("dot.path", default=...)`

Read deployment-scoped bundle secrets through:

- `get_secret("b:...")`

Write them through:

- `await set_bundle_prop(...)`
- `await set_bundle_secret(...)`

Typical use:

- feature flags
- cron expressions
- model selection
- MCP service configuration
- bundle UI configuration
- bundle-specific shared credentials

Important:

- `self.bundle_prop(...)` reads effective runtime bundle config
- `get_plain("b:...")` reads the raw mounted `bundles.yaml` file only
- these are not the same thing

### Reserved platform-owned bundle props still live here

Some bundle prop paths are interpreted specially by the platform.

They are still ordinary deployment-scoped bundle props from a storage and
ownership perspective.

They are not a fourth scope.

Common reserved paths:

| Path | Who interprets it | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `role_models` | platform entrypoint/runtime | model-role routing |
| `embedding` | platform entrypoint/runtime | embedding provider/model override |
| `economics.reservation_amount_dollars` | economics entrypoint/runtime | reservation floor |
| `execution.runtime` | runtime/exec subsystem | bundle-level execution runtime routing |
| `exec_runtime` | runtime/exec subsystem | legacy alias for `execution.runtime` |
| `mcp.services` | MCP runtime/bootstrap | MCP transport/auth config |

Use the detailed page for those reserved paths:

- [bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md](../sdk/bundle/bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md)

## User-scoped bundle props and secrets

These values belong to one user inside one bundle inside one deployment.

Use:

- `get_user_prop(...)`
- `set_user_prop(...)`
- `delete_user_prop(...)`
- `get_user_secret(...)`
- `set_user_secret(...)`
- `delete_user_secret(...)`

Typical use:

- one user's preferences
- one user's personal integration tokens
- one user's bundle-managed non-secret operational state
- one user's bundle-managed secret operational state

Important ownership rule:

- the bundle is the logical owner of this state
- platform descriptors do not become the storage for this state
- if the bundle wants export/import for this state, the bundle must provide its
  own API or workflow

## Export and ejection rules

`kdcube --export-live-bundles` is bundle-state export only.

It exports:

- `bundles.yaml`
- `bundles.secrets.yaml`

It does not export:

- `assembly.yaml`
- `gateway.yaml`
- `secrets.yaml`
- user props
- user secrets

So the rule is:

- deployment-scoped bundle config can be ejected back into bundle descriptors
- platform/global deployment config stays in deployment descriptors and
  deployment secret workflows
- user-scoped bundle state remains operational data unless the bundle provides
  its own export path

## What bundle code is allowed to mutate

Supported directly from normal bundle code:

- read platform/global props via `get_settings()`
- read platform/global secrets via `get_secret("canonical.key")`
- read deployment-scoped bundle props via `self.bundle_prop(...)`
- read deployment-scoped bundle secrets via `get_secret("b:...")`
- write deployment-scoped bundle props via `await set_bundle_prop(...)`
- write deployment-scoped bundle secrets via `await set_bundle_secret(...)`
- read/write user-scoped bundle props via `get_user_prop(...)`, `set_user_prop(...)`
- read/write user-scoped bundle secrets via `get_user_secret(...)`, `set_user_secret(...)`

That distinction matters:

- platform/global state is deployment-owned and not writable from normal bundle
  code
- deployment-scoped bundle writes are operational/configuration writes
- user-scoped writes are part of normal bundle runtime behavior

## Raw reads versus effective reads

Use these categories deliberately.

### Effective runtime reads

These are the values the runtime is actually meant to use:

- `get_settings()`
- `get_secret(...)`
- `self.bundle_prop(...)`
- `get_user_prop(...)`
- `get_user_secret(...)`

### Raw descriptor reads

These read mounted files as files:

- `get_plain(...)`
- `read_plain(...)`

They do not:

- merge code defaults
- include Redis bundle-prop overrides
- include user state
- persist changes anywhere

## Storage and authority model

The exact storage and authority model is intentionally documented separately.

Use:

- [runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md](runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md)

That page owns:

- mode-specific authority by local file mode vs `aws-sm`
- Redis cache role
- current bundle prop write path
- current bundle secret persistence path
- PostgreSQL and secrets-provider ownership for user state
- grouped AWS SM document layout
