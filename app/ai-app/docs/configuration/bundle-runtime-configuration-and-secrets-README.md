# Bundle Runtime Settings, Configuration, and Secrets

This is the single SDK page bundle authors should use for programmatic access
to settings, props, and secrets.

Tier 1 rule:

- this page is one part of the Tier 1 pack
- do not treat it as sufficient on its own
- read it together with the Tier 1 test, authoring, and configure/run pages

Use this page when you need to answer questions like:

- which scope does this value belong to
- should this value live in platform/global config, bundle config, or user state
- which helper should read it
- which helper may write it
- where does it actually live at runtime
- what can be exported back out of the system

This page intentionally covers all relevant runtime value classes, not only
bundle-scoped values.

Tier 1 role of this page:

- use it first when your job is configuring a bundle
- use it first when you must translate an existing application's settings into
  KDCube terms
- use it after `how-to-write` when you need to decide where values belong
- use it before `how-to-configure-and-run` when descriptor modeling is still
  unclear

If you need the detailed storage and authority model after that, use:

- [runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md](runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md)

If you need the concise bundle-author lifecycle for code defaults,
descriptor/admin props, effective bundle props, and bundle secrets, use:

- [bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle-README.md](../sdk/bundle/bundle-properties-and-secrets-lifecycle-README.md)

If you need the list of reserved bundle prop paths interpreted by the platform,
use:

- [bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md](../sdk/bundle/bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md)

## The three scopes

There are three scopes bundle authors must reason about:

1. platform/global
2. deployment-scoped bundle
3. user-scoped bundle

Across those scopes, there are six concrete data classes that matter in
practice:

1. platform/global props
2. platform/global secrets
3. deployment-scoped bundle props
4. deployment-scoped bundle secrets
5. user-scoped bundle props
6. user-scoped bundle secrets

Bundle code may read all six classes through the supported helpers.

Normal bundle code should write only:

- deployment-scoped bundle props
- deployment-scoped bundle secrets
- user-scoped bundle props
- user-scoped bundle secrets

Bundle code should not write platform/global props or platform/global secrets.
Those remain deployment-owned.

## Exact scope matrix

| Data class | Read API | Write API from bundle code | Ownership boundary | Live authority today | Export / ejection path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| platform/global props | `get_settings()` for effective values; `get_plain("...")` for raw descriptor inspection | none supported | tenant + project deployment | promoted runtime config assembled from env plus descriptor files such as `assembly.yaml` and `gateway.yaml` | exported by `kdcube config export --include-platform-descriptors`; otherwise manage through deployment descriptors |
| platform/global secrets | `await get_secret("canonical.key")` | none supported | tenant + project deployment | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `secrets.yaml` | exported by `kdcube config export --include-platform-descriptors` only when the provider/export flow can reconstruct them; otherwise manage through deployment secret workflows |
| deployment-scoped bundle props | `self.bundle_prop(...)`, `self.bundle_props` | `await set_bundle_prop(...)` | tenant + project + bundle | configured bundle descriptor authority; Redis is the runtime cache. Recommended cloud mode is writable mounted `bundles.yaml` with `BUNDLES_DESCRIPTOR_PROVIDER=file`. | exported to `bundles.yaml`; `kdcube config export` includes it |
| deployment-scoped bundle secrets | `await get_secret("b:...")` | `await set_bundle_secret(...)` | tenant + project + bundle | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `bundles.secrets.yaml` | exported to `bundles.secrets.yaml` when the provider/export flow can reconstruct them |
| user-scoped bundle props | `get_user_prop(...)`, `get_user_props()` | `set_user_prop(...)`, `delete_user_prop(...)` | tenant + project + bundle + user | PostgreSQL `<SCHEMA>.user_bundle_props` | never exported to descriptors or bundle export |
| user-scoped bundle secrets | `await get_secret("u:...")` | `await set_user_secret(...)`, `await delete_user_secret(...)` | tenant + project + bundle + user | configured secrets provider; in local `secrets-file` mode this is `secrets.yaml` | never exported to descriptors or bundle export |

In the user-scoped rows, `user` means the resolved bundle user scope. It may be
a KDCube account id in control-plane chat/widgets, but public integrations can
resolve a bundle-owned external identity such as `telegram_<telegram_user_id>`
or another stable mapped user key. Do not assume every bundle user owns a KDCube
login.

## Per-invocation portable context

In addition to stored configuration, the runtime has one request-scoped portable
context room: `bundle_call_context`.

This is not a seventh stored data class. It is not exported and it is not
durable. It is a JSON-safe bundle-owned payload attached to the current
`ExternalEventPayload`, rebound through task-local contextvars, and restored into
child runtimes through `RUNTIME_GLOBALS_JSON`.

Use `bundle_call_context` for values that should follow the current execution
across supported runtimes:

- bundle entrypoint methods
- `@api` and widget operations
- `@on_job` handlers
- in-process tools
- isolated exec / Docker / Fargate tool runtimes

Read it with:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import get_current_bundle_call_context

ctx = get_current_bundle_call_context()
```

Set or temporarily extend it with:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import (
    bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch,
    update_current_bundle_call_context,
)

update_current_bundle_call_context({"my_bundle": {"request_mode": "preview"}})

with bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch({"my_bundle": {"request_mode": "final"}}):
    await run_nested_work()
```

Tool code can also read it through:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.bundle_tool_context import scope

call_context = scope()["bundle_call_context"]
```

Use this room for small per-call metadata, not for durable settings or secrets.
If the value must affect a future request, store it in the appropriate durable
scope first: job metadata/payload, bundle props, user props, or bundle storage.

Reserved platform-interpreted key:

| Key inside `bundle_call_context` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `role_models` | request-scoped overlay over effective bundle `role_models`; used by the model router for model-role selection during the bound invocation |

Role model scope diagram:

```text
bundle source default
configuration / configuration_defaults()
        |
deployment override
bundles.yaml -> items[].config.role_models
or live bundle props
        |
current invocation overlay
bundle_call_context.role_models
        |
SDK ModelRouter(role)
```

Deployment-level model selection is a bundle prop:

```yaml
items:
  - id: my.bundle@1-0
    config:
      role_models:
        report.writer:
          provider: anthropic
          model: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

One API/MCP/cron/chat/job call can temporarily override the same role without
mutating bundle props:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.runtime.comm_ctx import (
    bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch,
    get_current_bundle_call_context,
)

ctx = get_current_bundle_call_context()
role_models = dict(ctx.get("role_models") or {})
role_models["report.writer"] = {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
}

with bind_current_bundle_call_context_patch({"role_models": role_models}):
    await run_report_agent()
```

The overlay follows nested SDK agents, React, in-process tools, and isolated
tool runtimes while the context is bound. For surface-specific examples, see
[Bundle Agent Integration](../sdk/bundle/bundle-agent-integration-README.md#model-selection-for-agent-roles).

## Decide the scope before you write code

| If the value belongs to... | Use | Do not use |
|---|---|---|
| the environment or platform deployment as a whole | `get_settings()` or `await get_secret("canonical.key")` | `self.bundle_prop(...)` |
| one bundle for the whole deployment | `self.bundle_prop(...)` or `await get_secret("b:...")` | user props or user secrets |
| one user inside one bundle | `get_user_prop(...)` or `await get_secret("u:...")` | `bundles.yaml` or `bundles.secrets.yaml` |

Examples:

- OpenAI API key shared by all bundles in the deployment -> platform/global secret
- OpenAI API key for one specific bundle -> deployment-scoped bundle secret (`services.openai.api_key`)
- auth client id -> platform/global prop
- bundle feature flag or cron expression -> deployment-scoped bundle prop
- bundle webhook token shared by the deployment -> deployment-scoped bundle secret
- one user's theme preference -> user-scoped bundle prop
- one user's personal GitHub token -> user-scoped bundle secret

## Async-first helper rule

Bundle runtime paths are async. In new bundle code, especially `@api`,
`@mcp`, `@ui_widget`, `@cron`, `@on_job`, lifecycle hooks, and tool functions,
use the async helpers:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.config import (
    get_secret,
    set_user_secret,
    delete_user_secret,
    set_bundle_secret,
)
```

Use:

- `await get_secret("canonical.key")` for platform/global secrets
- `await get_secret("b:group.key")` for current-bundle deployment secrets
- `await get_secret("b:services.openai.api_key") or await get_secret("services.openai.api_key")`
  for service keys when a bundle-specific override should win before the platform fallback
  (see [bundles-secrets-descriptor-README.md](bundles-secrets-descriptor-README.md)
  for the list of overridable `services.*` keys)
- `await get_secret("u:group.key")` for current-user bundle secrets
- `await set_user_secret("group.key", value)` for user secret writes
- `await delete_user_secret("group.key")` for user secret deletes
- `await set_bundle_secret("group.key", value)` for deployment-scoped bundle
  secret writes

Do not read secrets through provider internals or direct bundle secret fields.
The bundle-facing contract is async so request, tool, cron, and job handlers do
not block the event loop on secret provider IO.

Scope resolution:

- `b:...` uses the bound current bundle id
- user-secret helpers use the bound current user and bundle when explicit
  `user_id` / `bundle_id` are not supplied
- background jobs restore the runtime request context before bundle execution,
  so job tools can read user secrets through the same helper contract

## Platform/global props and secrets

These are deployment-owned values, not bundle-owned values.

Use:

- `get_settings()` for effective typed runtime settings
- `await get_secret("canonical.key")` for deployment-scoped platform/global secrets
- `get_plain("...")` only when you intentionally need the raw descriptor file

Typical examples:

- ports
- auth type and ids
- storage backend selection
- path roots
- deployment-wide API keys shared by many bundles

Do not store these in:

- `bundles.yaml`
- `bundles.secrets.yaml`
- user props
- user secrets

## Deployment-scoped bundle props and secrets

These values belong to one bundle inside one deployment environment.

Read effective bundle props through:

- `self.bundle_props`
- `self.bundle_prop("dot.path", default=...)`

Read deployment-scoped bundle secrets through:

- `await get_secret("b:...")`

Write them through:

- `await set_bundle_prop(...)`
- `await set_bundle_secret(...)`

Typical use:

- feature flags
- cron expressions
- model selection
- MCP service configuration
- bundle UI configuration
- bundle-specific shared credentials

Important:

- `self.bundle_prop(...)` reads effective runtime bundle config
- `get_plain("b:...")` reads the raw mounted `bundles.yaml` file only
- these are not the same thing

### Reserved platform-owned bundle props still live here

Some bundle prop paths are interpreted specially by the platform.

They are still ordinary deployment-scoped bundle props from a storage and
ownership perspective.

They are not a fourth scope.

Common reserved paths:

| Path | Who interprets it | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `role_models` | platform entrypoint/runtime | model-role routing |
| `embedding` | platform entrypoint/runtime | embedding provider/model override |
| `economics.reservation_amount_dollars` | economics entrypoint/runtime | reservation floor |
| `react.default_agent.line_numbers_mode` | ReAct runtime | rendered text preview line numbering mode for the default ReAct agent: `disabled`, `lines`, or `sparsed`; global/default value is `lines` |
| `react.default_agent.event_source_pipeline.enabled` | ReAct runtime | default-agent opt-in for the alternate event-source policy pipeline; global/default value is `false`; use `react.<agent_key>.*` or `react.agents.<agent_key>.*` for additional agents |
| `execution.runtime` | runtime/exec subsystem | bundle-level execution routing and per-run ISO limits |
| `exec_runtime` | runtime/exec subsystem | legacy alias for `execution.runtime` |
| `surfaces.as_consumer` | SDK tool, event-source, pull, and UI resolver subsystems | bundle consumer wiring: per-agent tools, external object/event-source policies, and UI resolvers |
| `tools.agents` | SDK tool subsystem / ReAct runtime | legacy per-agent model-callable tool connections and allow-lists; prefer `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.*.tools` for new descriptors |
| `mcp.services` | MCP runtime/bootstrap | MCP client transport/auth config for MCP services the bundle consumes |
| `mcp.<endpoint_alias>.auth` | proc MCP bridge or bundle MCP app | auth metadata for a bundle-provided `@mcp` endpoint; `mode: managed` is enforced by the platform bridge, absent `mode` is bundle-owned metadata |

For provided MCP endpoints, `enabled.mcp.<alias>` only controls whether the
endpoint is published. Endpoint auth policy lives separately under
`mcp.<alias>.auth`.

Example platform-managed endpoint policy:

```yaml
mcp:
  feedback:
    auth:
      mode: managed
      authority_id: oauth_mcp
      tools:
        conversations_export:
          grants: [conversations:read]
      selected_tool_grants: true
```

Example bundle-owned header-token metadata, used by the knowledge bundle:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_provider:
    mcp:
      knowledge:
        auth:
          mode: bundle
          header_name: X-Knowledge-MCP-Token
```

In the first example, the proc bridge verifies the delegated bearer credential
and each called MCP tool's required grants before dispatching to the bundle MCP
app. In the second example, `mode: bundle` means the platform treats the block
as bundle-owned metadata and the bundle MCP app remains responsible for its own
domain-specific access context.

Use the detailed page for those reserved paths:

- [bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md](../sdk/bundle/bundle-reserved-platform-properties-README.md)

For ISO runtime filesystem limits, platform defaults come from
`assembly.yaml` under `platform.services.proc.exec`. A bundle may override only
its own run with `execution.runtime.max_file_bytes`,
`execution.runtime.max_exec_workspace_delta_bytes`,
`execution.runtime.max_workspace_bytes`, and
`execution.runtime.workspace_monitor_interval_s`.

For Docker/Fargate exec supervisors, descriptor payloads are full by default.
Set `execution.runtime.descriptor_payload_scope: active_bundle` to filter only
`bundles.yaml` and `bundles.secrets.yaml` to the active bundle before transport.
Platform/global descriptors and global secrets stay deployment-scoped.

### Consumer surfaces

`surfaces.as_consumer` is deployment-scoped bundle configuration. It belongs in
`bundles.yaml` or bundle `configuration_defaults()`, not in user-scoped props.
Use it to describe what this bundle consumes from the platform and from other
bundles:

- agent model-callable tools
- event-source policies for external object refs
- pull/materialization policy for external objects
- UI resolver wiring such as canvas object actions

Example:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    default_agent: main
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: web
            kind: python
            module: kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.tools.web_tools
            alias: web_tools
            allowed: [web_search, web_fetch]
            tool_traits:
              web_search:
                strategy: [exploration]
              web_fetch:
                strategy: [exploration]
          - id: docs
            kind: mcp
            server_id: docs
            alias: docs
            allowed: [search, fetch]
            tool_traits:
              search:
                strategy: [exploration]
              fetch:
                strategy: [exploration]
          - id: task_service
            kind: named_service
            alias: named_services
            namespaces:
              task:
                allowed:
                  - provider.about
                  - object.list
                  - object.search
                  - object.schema
                  - object.host_file
                  - object.upsert
                  - object.delete
            tool_traits:
              provider_about:
                strategy: [exploration]
              list_objects:
                strategy: [exploration]
              search_objects:
                strategy: [exploration]
              object_schema:
                strategy: [exploration]
              host_file:
                strategy: [exploitation]
              upsert_object:
                strategy: [exploitation]
              delete_object:
                strategy: [exploitation]
        event_sources:
          - kind: named_service
            namespace: task
            enabled: true
            discovery:
              mode: service_discovery
            policies:
              block_production:
                mode: provider
                operation: block.produce
              pull:
                mode: provider
                operation: object.get
    ui:
      canvas:
        resolvers:
          - kind: named_service
            namespace: task
            enabled: true
            discovery:
              mode: service_discovery
            allowed: [object.resolve, object.action]
```

This config controls visibility, not secrets:

- Python sources use `module` or bundle-local `ref`.
- MCP sources reference `server_id`; transport/auth still live in
  `mcp.services`.
- `tool_traits` is consumer-side metadata for this agent's tool policy. The
  first runtime trait is `strategy`, used by ReAct multi-action compatibility.
- Named-service agent tools are configured with provider operation ids, then
  exposed to ReAct as concrete `named_services.*` tools. ReAct catalog entries
  render only `namespaces applicable`, so the model sees which namespaces may
  use each generic tool without seeing provider protocol ids.
- Existing external object refs should normally be materialized with
  `react.pull`; the pull policy calls provider `object.get` and writes an `fi:`
  artifact with provider-selected MIME.
- Agent-owned runtime files can be hosted into a provider namespace only when
  the namespace allows `object.host_file`; ReAct then sees
  `named_services.host_file` for that namespace and receives a provider-owned
  ref to cite through the provider's object schema.
- Canvas object actions belong under
  `surfaces.as_consumer.ui.canvas.resolvers`; the owning provider decides what
  each resolver action may do.

Different agents can expose different tools:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_consumer:
    agents:
      main:
        tools:
          - id: automations
            kind: python
            module: kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.automations.tools
            alias: automations
            allowed: [list_automations, search_automations, create_automation]
      automation_job:
        tools:
          - id: automation_job
            kind: python
            module: kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.automations.job_tools
            alias: automation_job
            allowed: [get_current_automation, update_execution_journal]
```

`tools.agents` remains a legacy fallback for older bundles. Do not use both
shapes for the same agent in new descriptors; `surfaces.as_consumer` is the
canonical surface.

Use this split when a bundle has both an interactive assistant and a scheduled
job executor. The job executor should not inherit write tools merely because the
interactive assistant has them.

## User-scoped bundle props and secrets

These values belong to one user inside one bundle inside one deployment.

Use:

- `get_user_prop(...)`
- `set_user_prop(...)`
- `delete_user_prop(...)`
- `await get_secret("u:...")`
- `await set_user_secret(...)`
- `await delete_user_secret(...)`

Typical use:

- one user's preferences
- one user's personal integration tokens
- one user's bundle-managed non-secret operational state
- one user's bundle-managed secret operational state

Important ownership rule:

- the bundle is the logical owner of this state
- platform descriptors do not become the storage for this state
- if the bundle wants export/import for this state, the bundle must provide its
  own API or workflow

## Export and ejection rules

`kdcube config export` exports bundle descriptors by default.

By default, it exports:

- `bundles.yaml`
- `bundles.secrets.yaml`

With `--include-platform-descriptors`, it also exports deployment descriptors
that can be reconstructed from the local runtime:

- `assembly.yaml`
- `gateway.yaml`
- `secrets.yaml`

It never exports:

- user props
- user secrets

So the rule is:

- deployment-scoped bundle config can be ejected back into bundle descriptors
- platform/global deployment config stays in deployment descriptors and
  deployment secret workflows
- user-scoped bundle state remains operational data unless the bundle provides
  its own export path

## What bundle code is allowed to mutate

Supported directly from normal bundle code:

- read platform/global props via `get_settings()`
- read platform/global secrets via `await get_secret("canonical.key")`
- read deployment-scoped bundle props via `self.bundle_prop(...)`
- read deployment-scoped bundle secrets via `await get_secret("b:...")`
- write deployment-scoped bundle props via `await set_bundle_prop(...)`
- write deployment-scoped bundle secrets via `await set_bundle_secret(...)`
- read/write user-scoped bundle props via `get_user_prop(...)`, `set_user_prop(...)`
- read/write user-scoped bundle secrets via `await get_secret("u:...")`,
  `await set_user_secret(...)`, and `await delete_user_secret(...)`

That distinction matters:

- platform/global state is deployment-owned and not writable from normal bundle
  code
- deployment-scoped bundle writes are operational/configuration writes
- user-scoped writes are part of normal bundle runtime behavior
- user-scoped writes are keyed by bundle user scope, which may be an external
  identity accepted by the bundle

## Raw reads versus effective reads

Use these categories deliberately.

### Effective runtime reads

These are the values the runtime is actually meant to use:

- `get_settings()`
- `get_secret("u:...")`
- `self.bundle_prop(...)`
- `get_user_prop(...)`
- `set_user_secret(...)` / `delete_user_secret(...)`

### Raw descriptor reads

These read mounted files as files:

- `get_plain(...)`
- `read_plain(...)`

They do not:

- merge code defaults
- include Redis bundle-prop overrides
- include user state
- persist changes anywhere

## Storage and authority model

The exact storage and authority model is intentionally documented separately.

Use:

- [runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md](runtime-configuration-and-secrets-store-README.md)

That page owns:

- mode-specific authority by local file mode vs `aws-sm`
- Redis cache role
- current bundle prop write path
- current bundle secret persistence path
- PostgreSQL and secrets-provider ownership for user state
- grouped AWS SM document layout
