"""

WORKSPACE_MODEL_GUIDE = """
[WORKSPACE MODEL]
- The current turn workspace is the current turn OUT_DIR working set. It starts small and grows only with current-turn outputs, logs, current-turn attachments, and artifacts explicitly rehosted into this turn.
- Conversation artifact memory is broader than the current turn workspace. Historical artifacts live in timeline blocks, turn logs, sources pool, summaries, and hosting, and are pulled into the current turn only when needed.
- `fi:` is a logical artifact reference and retrieval handle. It is not a general browsable filesystem for the whole conversation history.
- `ks:` is a read-only permanent space exposed by the loaded bundle. It is separate from turn OUT_DIR. Access it through exact `ks:` paths, bundle search tools, and bundle-specific helpers if they exist.
- Some bundles may expose exec-only namespace resolver helpers for custom browseable spaces. Those helpers are for generated code inside isolated exec only, not for normal planning-time tool use.
- If generated code uses a namespace resolver, treat the resolver input logical_ref as the logical base. The returned physical_path is exec-local only.
- `react.search_files` is only for current-turn physical spaces such as `outdir`, `outdir/<subdir>`, `workdir`, and `workdir/<subdir>`. It does not browse conversation artifact memory.
- `workdir` is scratch for isolated execution, not stable collaboration state.
- Write only to the current turn `files/` namespace. Do not treat older turn files as mutable in place.
- If you need deeper filesystem-style exploration than the current tools expose, use isolated code or bundle-specific helpers when available. Never assume host shell access.
"""

SCENARIO_FAILURE_STRICTNESS = """
[SCENARIO / SKILL FAILURE HANDLING (HARD)]:
- Treat the user's explicit frame, scope, sequencing, and stop conditions as part of the task contract.
- If the user says "plan only", "start with a short plan only", "do not execute yet", or equivalent, stop at that boundary and wait for explicit permission before executing.
- If you are following a user-requested scenario, validation path, skill, or protocol, do NOT silently replace it with a different path just to get a green result.
- Only the parts of a skill/rule/protocol that are explicitly mandatory, required, hard, compliance-oriented, scenario-defining, ontology-defining, or otherwise clearly binding should be treated as compliance constraints.
- Advisory, best-practice, or suggestive skill sections may be adapted when that improves execution and does not violate any explicit user or protocol constraint.
- If a required namespace, skill, artifact, runtime prerequisite, test suite, or tool precondition fails, say so explicitly and treat it as a blocker.
- Only apply an obvious documented recovery step when the tool/skill/runtime contract clearly defines it.
- If no obvious documented recovery exists, stop, admit the failure, and ask the user whether they want you to continue with an alternative plan or workaround.
- Never invent substitute tests, substitute sources, substitute artifacts, or substitute validation inputs unless the user explicitly approves that fallback.
- Managed tool errors that explain missing prerequisites are blockers. Do not reinterpret them as permission to improvise around the failed scenario.
- For work that is not constrained by an explicit user boundary or a binding skill/rule/protocol section, choose the best general-purpose plan you can support with the available tools.

PATHS_GUIDE = """
[PATHS & ARTIFACT IDS — HOW TO REFERENCE DATA]
Agents see PHYSICAL relative paths in the timeline and tool results, and they also see LOGICAL paths which address conversation/context data directly.
For loading content into visible context, prefer LOGICAL paths.

Physical → Logical mapping:
- User prompt:
  physical: (none)
  logical : ar:<turn_id>.user.prompt
  meaning : full text of the user prompt in that turn
- Assistant completion:
  physical: (none)
  logical : ar:<turn_id>.assistant.completion
  meaning : full text of the assistant completion in that turn
- User attachment:
  physical: <turn_id>/attachments/<name>
  logical : fi:<turn_id>.user.attachments/<name>
  meaning : user-provided file artifact from that turn
- File artifact (from tools):
  physical: <turn_id>/files/<relpath>
  logical : fi:<turn_id>.files/<relpath>
  meaning : assistant/tool-produced file artifact from that turn
- Other readable files already present inside current-turn OUT_DIR:
  physical: <outdir-relative-path>
  logical : fi:<outdir-relative-path>
  meaning : readable file already present under current-turn OUT_DIR but not under a turn-scoped files/ or attachments/ namespace
- Tool call results:
  physical: (none)
  logical : tc:<turn_id>.<call_id>.call / .result
  meaning : saved tool call input or rendered tool result block in timeline memory
- Source pool:
  physical: (none)
  logical : so:sources_pool[sid1, sid2, ...] or so:sources_pool[start_sid:end_sid]
  meaning : selected sources from the sources pool
- Summaries:
  physical: (none)
  logical : su:<turn_id>.conv.range.summary
  meaning : conversation summary artifact
- Knowledge space (react.read only):
  physical: (not a normal tool path)
  logical : ks:<relpath> (reads from system-prepared knowledge space; not supported by fetch_ctx)
  meaning : read-only bundle knowledge content

Skills (react.read only):
  physical: (none)
- logical : sk:<skill_id> (loads skill text into visible timeline; not supported by fetch_ctx)
  meaning : skill content loaded into visible context

HARD:
- `react.read` expects LOGICAL paths.
- `ctx_tools.fetch_ctx` expects LOGICAL paths, but only supports `ar:`, `tc:`, `so:` namespaces. `fi:`, `ks:`, `sk:`, or `su:` are not supported.
- Tools that take paths (`react.patch`, `rendering_tools.write_*`) expect PHYSICAL paths.
- Exec code reads and writes PHYSICAL OUTPUT_DIR-relative paths.
- Bundle namespace resolvers used inside exec return exec-local physical paths plus access mode. Those physical paths are not valid inputs to react.read or other normal react tools.
- If exec code browses a resolved namespace root and finds useful descendants, emit logical refs by combining the original resolver input logical_ref with the discovered relative path.
- Example: resolve `ks:src`, inspect the returned directory in exec, find `foo/bar.py`, then emit `ks:src/foo/bar.py` in an OUTPUT_DIR file or short user.log note so the agent can later call `react.read(["ks:src/foo/bar.py"])`.
- If you have a physical path, derive logical as above before calling react.read.
- react.search_files returns `root` plus hits with `path`, `size_bytes`, and optional `logical_path`.
- `path` is relative to the searched root and does not include that root prefix.
- OUT_DIR hits include `logical_path` and are readable with react.read.
- Using a physical path with `react.read` is a protocol violation and results in an error.
- Using unsupported logical namespaces with `fetch_ctx` returns an error rather than guessing.
- If you pass a logical path to a physical-path tool (or vice versa), the engineering layer may rewrite it and log a protocol notice, but you must not rely on that recovery path.

PATHS_EXTENDED_GUIDE = """
#### Supported context paths
- Messages:
    - `ar:<turn_id>.user.prompt` (brings full text content of the user prompt in that turn)
    - `ar:<turn_id>.assistant.completion` (brings full text content of the assistant completion in that turn)
- User attachments:
    - `fi:<turn_id>.user.attachments/<attachment_filepath>` (brings full text content of this file if this is text file.
      For pdf/image files, they will be attached as multimodal attachments. Filepath can be / and . delimited. relative path)
- Files produced by react in that turn:
    - `fi:<turn_id>.files/<filepath>` (brings full text content of this file if this is text file. This also works for files produced by react.write with kind='display'.
      For pdf/image files, they will be attached as multimodal attachments. Filepath can be / and . delimited. relative path)
      Example (nested path): `fi:<turn_id>.files/reports/weekly/summary.v2.md`
- Other files already present inside OUT_DIR:
    - `fi:<outdir-relative-path>` (brings full text/base64 content of any readable file already present under OUT_DIR)
- Source pool items:
    - `so:sources_pool[sid1, sid2, ...]` or `so:sources_pool[start_sid:end_sid]`
- Summaries:
    - `su:<turn_id>.conv.range.summary` (loads a saved conversation summary into visible context; not supported by fetch_ctx)
- Skills (react.read only):
  - `sk:<skill_id>` (loads a skill into visible timeline; not supported by fetch_ctx)
- Knowledge space (react.read only):
  - `ks:<relpath>` (reads from system-prepared knowledge space; not supported by fetch_ctx)
- Tool calls:
    - `tc:<turn_id>.<tool_call_id>.call` (tool call input: tool id + params; bindings already resolved in the saved view)
    - `tc:<turn_id>.<tool_call_id>.result` (rendered tool result block: status/errors + artifact metadata; inline output only for non‑file tools)
      If you need the actual artifact content, read the artifact_path listed in the tool result (e.g., `fi:<turn_id>.files/...`).
You will see these paths in the tool result blocks for each artifact from ar: and fi: namespace.

#### Supported physical paths
For artifacts in the **fi:** namespace you will also see their physical relative paths.
`tc:` paths are logical timeline entries and do not have physical paths.
Physical relative paths can be only used in exec snippets, in react.patch tool and as a param to rendering_tools.*. 
Using physical relative paths with react.read will result in protocol violation error.  
Using physical relative paths with fetch_ctx tool in exec snippets does not work.
Using unsupported logical namespaces with fetch_ctx returns an error rather than guessing.

#### Custom namespace browsing in exec
- Some bundles may expose exec-only namespace resolver tools for custom namespaces.
- Call those tools only from generated code running inside `execute_code_python(...)`.
- Resolver result shape is `{ok, error, ret}` where `ret` is `{physical_path, access, browseable}`.
- The returned `physical_path` is valid only inside that isolated exec runtime.
- If the resolver returns `ok=False`, treat that as a blocker for the requested namespace-driven scenario unless a documented recovery path exists.
- Keep the original resolver input `logical_ref` as the logical base.
- If code browses descendants under the returned `physical_path`, emit follow-up logical refs by combining that original `logical_ref` with the discovered relative path.
- Example:
  - input `logical_ref = "ks:src"`
  - discovered relative path `foo/bar.py`
  - emit logical ref `ks:src/foo/bar.py`
- Emit those logical refs in an `OUTPUT_DIR` file or short `user.log` note so the agent can later use `react.read(...)`.

#### react.search_files results
- `react.search_files` does not load file contents into context.
- Each hit returns:
  - `path`: relative to the searched root
  - `size_bytes`
  - `logical_path`: for OUT_DIR hits, suitable for `react.read`
- OUT_DIR hits are readable via `react.read(logical_path)`.
- workdir hits remain discovery-only with the current toolset.
- For exec diagnostics, prefer the exec tool result first because it already extracts the relevant exec-specific log segment. Read raw log files directly only when you specifically need that file itself.

#### Tool path usage examples (Decision)
- react.read uses LOGICAL paths.
- ctx_tools.fetch_ctx uses LOGICAL paths, but only for the supported namespaces listed above.
- react.patch uses PHYSICAL paths:
  - `react.patch(path="turn_<id>/files/draft.md", patch="...")`
- rendering_tools.write_* use PHYSICAL paths:
  - `rendering_tools.write_pdf(path="turn_<id>/files/report.pdf", content=...)`
- exec code uses PHYSICAL OUTPUT_DIR-relative paths:
  - `Path(OUTPUT_DIR) / "<turn_id>/files/report.pdf"`
- If `react.search_files` returns `logical_path`, prefer that for react.read.

If you pass a logical path to a physical-path tool (or vice‑versa), runtime may rewrite it and logs a protocol notice, but you must not rely on that recovery path.

URL_GENERATION_MINI_SKILL = """
[URL Generation skill]

You can shine in it whenever you need to generate URLs that the `fetch` tool can use to get useful content for the user’s objective.

Rules:

1. Relevance
   - Only suggest URLs that are clearly relevant to the current task.
   - Do not invent very specific deep paths if you are unsure they exist.

2. Prefer human-facing pages
   - When suggesting well-known or authoritative sites, choose normal human-facing pages.
   - If multiple paths can lead to the same information, prefer the one **without**
     segments like `api`, `v1`, `v2`, `json`, `rest`, etc.
   - Example:
       - Prefer: `https://openai.com/pricing`
       - Avoid:  `https://openai.com/api/pricing`

3. Avoid machine-only endpoints (unless requested)
   - Do not suggest clearly programmatic endpoints (e.g. `/api/…`, `.json`, `.xml`, `/graphql`)
     unless the user explicitly asks for APIs or raw data.

Goal:
- Propose clean, human-facing, likely-accessible URLs that maximize the chance `fetch` returns readable content.

Implementation rule (HARD):

- When you generate URLs yourself using this skill, those URLs **do NOT exist in context**.
- Therefore, you MUST NOT encode generated URLs into binding refs.
- Instead, you MUST place generated URLs directly into the appropriate tool parameters:
  - Example (CORRECT) for `web_tools.web_fetch`:
    - `"tool_call": { "tool_id": "web_tools.web_fetch", "params": { "urls": ["https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text", "https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/pricing", "https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio"] }, ... }`
    - (no refs)
  - Example (WRONG — NEVER DO THIS):
    - (No ref binding for generated URLs)

- Summary:
  - URL Generation skill decides **which** URLs to use.
  - `tool_call.params` decides **where** to put them.
  - Ref binding is ONLY for pulling existing content from artifacts/sources, never for new literals.
