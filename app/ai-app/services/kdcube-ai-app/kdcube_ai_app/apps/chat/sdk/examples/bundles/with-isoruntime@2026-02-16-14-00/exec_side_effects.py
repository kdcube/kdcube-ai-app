# ── exec_side_effects.py ──
# Executes user code WITHOUT an output contract (side-effects mode).
#
# Unlike exec_contract.py, this mode does NOT declare expected output files.
# Instead, it snapshots the output directory before execution, runs the code
# via _InProcessRuntime (subprocess / Docker — same isolation as contract mode),
# then diffs outdir before/after to discover created/modified files.
# Useful when the output set is unpredictable.
#
# Returns a tuple of (envelope, tool_params, diff):
#   - envelope:    execution result
#   - tool_params: metadata for timeline/reporting
#   - diff:        workspace_diff showing which files changed
