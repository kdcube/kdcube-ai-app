  Knowledge about the KDCube platform — a multi‑tenant, self‑hosted runtime + SDK
  for building AI assistants, copilots, and agentic apps. Covers bundles/workflows,
  streaming + timeline, tools/skills, isolated execution, economics/accounting,
  provenance/citations, and deployment options (local, EC2, ECS).
  Important: ensure this skill is always in front of your eyes ('read', marked with 💡) if the user is asking about KDCube or any topic which is related to KDCube tech and features.
  Read it is its not read yet before to answering to such questions.

# KDCube Product Knowledge

## Scope
Use this skill when the user asks about the KDCube platform, its architecture, or product capabilities —
especially **what they can build**, **how to add web search + citations**, or **how to deploy**.

## Knowledge space navigation
This bundle exposes a read‑only knowledge space:
- Start with `react.read(["ks:index.md"])` to see the current index.
- Use `react.search_knowledge(query=..., root="ks:docs")` to search docs.
- Use `react.read(["ks:docs/<path>"])` to open a doc.
- Use `react.read(["ks:src/<path>"])` to open referenced source files.
- Use `react.read(["ks:deploy/<path>"])` to open deployment artifacts (compose, env examples, ECS/EC2 docs).
The index is generated on bundle startup by scanning `docs/` and capturing each doc’s front‑matter.
Doc pages may include inline code refs (backticked `kdcube_ai_app/...`) or deploy refs relative to the configured deploy root.
Docs and sources are pulled from the repo configured in bundle props (`knowledge.repo`, `knowledge.ref`,
`knowledge.docs_root`, `knowledge.src_root`, `knowledge.deploy_root`).

Important limitations:
- `react.search_knowledge` primarily indexes docs metadata, not the whole source tree.
- Source and deploy files are often reachable by exact `ks:src/...` or `ks:deploy/...` path, but not always surfaced in advance.
- If the exact `ks:` path is not obvious, do not guess repeatedly.

When a doc references source/deploy files and the exact `ks:` path is unclear:
1. If the mapping is obvious, derive the exact logical path and `react.read` it directly.
2. If the mapping is not obvious or you need to browse descendants, use isolated exec with `execute_code_python(...)`.
3. Inside generated code, call `bundle_data.resolve_namespace("ks:src")` or `bundle_data.resolve_namespace("ks:deploy")`.
4. Browse the returned exec-local `physical_path`.
5. Emit exact logical refs such as `ks:src/foo/bar.py` or `ks:deploy/docker/docker-compose.yaml` into an OUTPUT_DIR file or short `user.log` note.
6. Back in the React loop, call `react.read(...)` on those emitted logical refs.

`bundle_data.resolve_namespace(...)` is exec-only. It is not a normal planning-time tool.

## Core points
- KDCube is a multi‑tenant platform for running AI apps as **bundles**.
- Bundles are Python packages that expose a workflow entrypoint and stream results.
- The runtime supports **live streaming**, **timeline state**, and **artifacts**.
- Tools can run in‑proc or isolated (local/docker/fargate).
- The platform supports **multi‑bundle** deployments with per‑request routing.
- Citations are produced from the **sources pool**; web search results can be added there.

## What you can build
- Customer‑facing assistants and copilots (multi‑tenant by design)
- Domain‑specific agents with custom tools/skills and isolated execution
- Streaming chat apps with live widgets and provenance
- Admin/ops dashboards and monitoring flows via bundles

## Deployment options
- Local dev (run services directly)
- Docker Compose (local or EC2)
- ECS/Fargate (with shared storage for bundles/exec workspace)

## Evidence and citations
This skill ships with sources in `sources.yaml`.
When this skill is loaded via `react.read("sk:product.kdcube")`, those sources are merged into the
`sources_pool`. Use `[[S:n]]` citations that correspond to the sources pool entries.

## When unsure
Search the knowledge space first (`react.search_knowledge` + `react.read`). If the needed
info is not in the knowledge space, or the exact `ks:` file path is still unclear after direct reads,
use exec-time namespace resolution as described above. If the needed info is still not in bundle knowledge,
use `web_tools.web_search` and cite sources.
