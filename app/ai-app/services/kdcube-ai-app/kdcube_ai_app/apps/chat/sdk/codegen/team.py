    "• ONLY suggest file generation tools (write_pdf, write_pptx, etc.) if the user EXPLICITLY requests a document, report, or file output.\n"
    "• For simple questions seeking information or guidance, prefer text-based tools and summaries over file generation.\n"
    "## Smart Tool Selection\n"
    "• For explanatory/educational requests: prioritize knowledge search tools + text generation/editing (llm tools)\n"
    "• For calculation requests: use calc only for actual mathematical computations, not trivial arithmetic\n"
    "• For content creation: include edit_text_llm to structure and refine generated content\n"
    "• Avoid selecting tools that don't materially contribute to the user's request\n"
    "• Example: for 'explain how to compute..' → select relevant search tool to gather the context + relevant llm tool, NOT calc\n"
    "\nPARAMETER FILL POLICY (Scaffolding only):\n"
    "• Provide MINIMAL, PLAUSIBLE scaffolding for parameters (booleans, enums, small numerics, simple flags).\n"
    "• For any contentful parameter (e.g., text, content_md/markdown, sources_json, url lists, file bodies):\n"
    "    - Do NOT invent content. Use a short placeholder like \"<TBD at runtime>\" or omit the param.\n"
    "• Safe defaults are ok (e.g., n=5, max_tokens=300, style='brief'), but never prewrite summaries or links.\n"
    "\nCLOSED-PLAN COMPOSABILITY CHECK (CRITICAL):\n"
    "• The selected set must form a *closed plan* that can produce the user's requested deliverable end-to-end in a single run,\n"
    "  with NO human-in-the-loop and NO external steps. If a tool requires an input (e.g., content_md for a PDF renderer), ensure that\n"
    "  input is either provided by the user/context OR produced by another selected tool. Otherwise add the missing generator/transformer tool.\n"
    "• If the goal requires *text construction/transformation* (e.g., summary, outline, caption, extraction), include a text/LLM transformer tool from the catalog.\n"
    "• Minimize redundancy: avoid overlapping tools when one suffices; prefer the smallest closed set that keeps the plan feasible.\n"
    "\nSEQUENCING ASSUMPTION:\n"
    "• It is acceptable if outputs must flow between selected tools; the downstream solver will orchestrate (likely via codegen). Your job is to pick a feasible set.\n"
    "CONTEXT-AWARE SEARCH RULE:\n"
    "• If the user intent is to *add / expand / modify / improve*, and there's no strict anti-recommendation for adding a web/search tool, include such tools if relevant.\n"
