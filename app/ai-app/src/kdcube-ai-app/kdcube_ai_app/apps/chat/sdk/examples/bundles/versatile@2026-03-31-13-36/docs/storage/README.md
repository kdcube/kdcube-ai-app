# Versatile Bundle Storage

This page explains which state the reference bundle owns, where it is stored,
and which files are canonical versus rebuildable. It is written for bundle
maintainers and bundle-builder copilots that need to debug a local deployment
or port the pattern into a real application bundle.

## Roots

The bundle uses the SDK `AIBundleStorage` backend. In local development the
root usually looks like:

```sh
B=/Users/elenaviter/.kdcube/dev-workspace/data/bundle-storage/demo-tenant/demo-project/versatile-2026-03-31-13-36
```

Use the actual tenant, project, bundle id, and storage backend from the
deployment. On cloud deployments this storage may be backed by shared filesystem
storage or another configured bundle-storage backend.

## Canonical Bundle Data

```text
$B/
  preferences/
    users/
      <user_id>/
        current.json
        events.jsonl
  admin/
    telegram-users.json
    telegram-updates/
      state.json
      <update_id>.json
  canvas/
    users/
      <user_id>/
        canvases/
          index.json
          <canvas_id>/
            latest.json
            revisions/
              <revision>.json
            objects/
              ...
```

### Preferences

`preferences/users/<user_id>/current.json` is the current materialized view
used by tools, widgets, and the chat workflow. It contains one current value per
preference key.

`preferences/users/<user_id>/events.jsonl` is the append-only observation
history. Chat auto-capture, tool calls, canvas edits, Excel imports, and
deletions all append events. The current view is then rewritten from the latest
state.

The current implementation is intentionally simple because this is a reference
bundle. It demonstrates the storage and UI pattern that the SDK
cross-conversation memory module will eventually replace.

### Telegram Registry

`admin/telegram-users.json` is the bundle-owned Telegram user registry. It maps
Telegram user ids to:

- Telegram chat id
- Telegram username
- optional KDCube user id
- bundle-local role: `anonymous`, `registered`, or `admin`
- default conversation id
- operator notes

Telegram users are recorded as `anonymous` when the webhook first sees them.
An operator must promote them to `registered` or `admin` before they can use
Telegram bot turns or Telegram Mini App APIs.

### Telegram Webhook Idempotency

`admin/telegram-updates/` stores update claim/completion records so Telegram
webhook retries do not execute the same update repeatedly. These files are
bundle operational state and should be preserved with the bundle storage root.

### Canvas

`canvas/users/<user_id>/canvases/index.json` is the per-user canvas manifest
for the active scene story.

`canvas/users/<user_id>/canvases/<canvas_id>/latest.json` is the latest
materialized board state. Revisions are retained under `revisions/` according
to `canvas.revision_retention`.

Canvas-owned text and attachments are stored under `objects/`. Proxy cards keep
their canonical object refs (`fi:`, `mem:`, `cnv:`, etc.) and are not rehosted
just because they were pinned.

## Rebuildable Data

```text
$B/
  ui/
    main_view/
      index.html
      assets/...
    widgets/
      versatile_chat/
        index.html
        assets/...
      memories/
        index.html
        assets/...
      versatile_webapp/
        index.html
        assets/...
  .kdcube.once/
    ui-widget-versatile_webapp.lock
```

Widget output under `ui/widgets/` is generated from:

```text
sdk://solutions/chat/ui/widget
sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories
ui/widgets/versatile_webapp/
```

It is safe to rebuild from source. The shared build lock under `.kdcube.once/`
prevents multiple workers from building the same static widget at the same
time.

The active main view is generated from:

```text
ui/scene/
```

The main view output is also rebuildable from source. The previous custom chat
implementation remains under `ui/main/` as legacy comparison source.

## Platform-Owned Conversation Data

Versatile bot turns still use the normal KDCube conversation store. Those
conversation records, uploaded files, generated artifacts, and turn logs are
platform-owned, not bundle-storage-owned.

The bundle connects Telegram messages to the normal chat workflow. Generated
files that must be delivered back to Telegram are hosted by the platform before
temporary execution workspaces are cleaned.

## Storage Map

| Purpose | Path or owner | Canonical? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current preferences | `$B/preferences/users/<user_id>/current.json` | Yes | Current key/value view used by tools and widget. |
| Preference event history | `$B/preferences/users/<user_id>/events.jsonl` | Yes | Append-only history for preference changes. |
| Telegram user registry | `$B/admin/telegram-users.json` | Yes | Operator-managed mapping from Telegram users to KDCube users/roles/conversations. |
| Telegram webhook update state | `$B/admin/telegram-updates/...` | Yes | Idempotency state for Bot API retries. |
| Canvas state | `$B/canvas/users/<user_id>/canvases/...` | Yes | Versioned board state and canvas-owned objects for the active scene. |
| Chat widget static output | `$B/ui/widgets/versatile_chat/...` | No | Built from `sdk://solutions/chat/ui/widget`. |
| Memory widget static output | `$B/ui/widgets/memories/...` | No | Built from `sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories`. |
| Widget static output | `$B/ui/widgets/versatile_webapp/...` | No | Built from `ui/widgets/versatile_webapp`. |
| Main view static output | bundle UI build output | No | Built from `ui/scene`. |
| Exec report artifact | platform turn artifacts | No | Created by `preferences_exec_report` and hosted by the platform if needed. |
| Chat timeline/files | platform conversation store | Yes, platform-owned | Normal KDCube conversation persistence. |

## Debugging

Set local roots:

```sh
B=/Users/elenaviter/.kdcube/dev-workspace/data/bundle-storage/demo-tenant/demo-project/versatile-2026-03-31-13-36
U=<user_id>
```

Inspect current preferences:

```sh
jq . "$B/preferences/users/$U/current.json"
```

Inspect preference event history:

```sh
tail -n 50 "$B/preferences/users/$U/events.jsonl"
```

Inspect Telegram registry:

```sh
jq . "$B/admin/telegram-users.json"
```

Find webhook update records:

```sh
find "$B/admin/telegram-updates" -type f -print
```

If the widget does not refresh after source changes, inspect or remove stale
build output only when no build is running. Canonical state is not under
`ui/widgets/`.
