#
# The preserved agent binds PLAIN LangChain tools (solution/tools.py) — "bring your
# own tools", external to the host and, running no accounted model calls, unmetered.
# This module adds the SECOND way: bind a KDCube-served MCP endpoint's tools as
# LangChain tools.
#
# The mechanism is now SHARED SDK, reused by any hosted LangGraph/LangChain agent:
#   - `solutions/connections/delegated_mcp.resolve_mcp_server_map` — framework-neutral:
#     turn the agent's `kind: mcp` connections into an MCP server map, minting a
#     per-user DELEGATED bearer for any connection marked `delegated: true` (the same
#     `@mcp`-surface auth platform bundles use) and injecting it; static connections
#     keep their declared headers.
#   - `frameworks/langchain/mcp.load_mcp_tools_from_server_map` — bind that map as
#     LangChain tools via `langchain-mcp-adapters` (degrades to none when absent).
#
# This bundle file is the thin adapter: pass the agent's connection list + this
# turn's user, get LangChain tools.
#
# ACCOUNTING (the honest rule — "marked = counted"): binding a tool via MCP does not
# by itself make it accounted; a tool whose KDCube-side implementation runs a marked
# model call IS metered, a plain lookup is not.

    Consent is demand-driven per tool: a turn's build cannot know which

    turn-start demand. Instead it binds a stub carrying the connection's name
    and claims; when the MODEL decides the user's request needs that
    capability, calling the stub raises exactly that connection's consent
    demand in chat (via ``announce``) and returns the agent-explainable consent
    result — the same attempt-time semantics connected-account tools have.
