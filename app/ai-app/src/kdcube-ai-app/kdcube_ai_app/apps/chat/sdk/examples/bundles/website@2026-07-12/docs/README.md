# Website App Design

## Boundary

The website app owns:

- the static website shell;
- which scene app is mounted;
- website title and presentation;
- browser handling of the standard scene config/auth messages.

The platform owns:

- active authority/provider configuration;
- resolved login and logout endpoints;
- `/profile` session truth;
- `/api/*` and `/platform/*` routes;
- building and serving app main views.

The platform runtime owns the site registry. OpenResty forwards stable root and
alias routes to proc. Proc projects active app descriptors into Redis on
startup/config changes, and every proc worker routes requests from an immutable
in-memory catalog. No proxy regeneration, request-time Redis read, or
request-time descriptor scan is needed when site declarations change.

bundles.yaml
  website.ui.main_view.site
          |
          +--> validated, versioned Redis site projection
          +--> proc hot site catalog: alias + hosts + default
          |
          +--> website public/site_config
                         |
browser ----------------+--> /api/cp-frontend-config
                         +--> /profile
                         +--> configured scene public/static

OpenResty / ---------------------> proc /api/integrations/site-root
OpenResty /sites/{alias}/{path} -> proc /api/integrations/sites/{alias}/{path}
Site CDN /{path} ---------------> proc /api/integrations/site-root/{path}
```

No site selection or scene composition belongs in `assembly.yaml`.

Root resolution is deterministic:

1. select the single site whose `hosts` entry matches the request host;
2. otherwise select the single site with `default: true`;
3. otherwise redirect to the configured platform chat route.

Duplicate aliases, ambiguous host matches, and multiple defaults are invalid
registry states and return `503` rather than selecting an arbitrary site.

The website uses the normal main-view cache policy: entry HTML and root-level
non-hashed shell files revalidate, while content-hashed `assets/` files are
immutable. The public-content publication subsystem is not involved.

The CDN preserves `Host` or `X-Forwarded-Host`; proc uses it to select the site.
The CDN stores no catalog and may cache the returned HTML/assets according to
the platform headers.
