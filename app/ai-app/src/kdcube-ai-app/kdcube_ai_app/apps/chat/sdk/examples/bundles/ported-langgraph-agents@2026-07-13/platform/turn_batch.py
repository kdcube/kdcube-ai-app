# ── turn_batch.py ── deliver the WHOLE ingress batch to this turn ──
#
# A browser message arrives at ingress as one BATCH of external events —
# context events, the user prompt, and one `event.user.attachment.file` event
# per hosted file — sharing a `batch_id`. The platform dispatches the turn as
# a conversation event-lane *wakeup* that names ONE of those events (the
# prompt), and the wakeup's rehydrated `request.external_events` carries only
# that event. The ReAct workflow never notices: it opens the lane and folds
# every pending event itself. This bundle's run-to-completion `execute_core`
# reads only `state["external_events"]` — so without this seam the turn never
# sees the attachment events (the model answered "whats here" blind to the
# attached image).
#
# This module is the bundle-local equivalent of ReAct's lane fold, scoped to
# exactly this turn's batch: read the lane, take the wakeup event's batch
# siblings (skipping any a previous turn already consumed — a re-woken queued
# followup promotes alone), and hand back the accepted-event dicts in lane
# order. READ-ONLY on the lane: no consumption marks, no reservation changes —
# lane bookkeeping stays with the shared finalize exactly as it behaves today.
#
# Fail-open everywhere: any trouble (no wakeup context, no redis, lane read
# fails) leaves the dispatched events untouched.
