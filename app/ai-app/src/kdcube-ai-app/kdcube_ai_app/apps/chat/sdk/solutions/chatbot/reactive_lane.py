"""Reactive-event lane finalization for the run-to-completion turn path.

Every reactive turn is dispatched to the processor as a conversation
external-event lane *wakeup*, which reserves the lane consumer
(``consumer_status="scheduled"``) before the turn runs. A turn whose
``execute_core`` drives a ``BaseWorkflow`` (the ReAct path) opens the lane
handler and releases that reservation itself (``react/browser.py``:
``close_external_event_handler`` + ``post_save_external_event_handoff``). A
run-to-completion ``execute_core`` is bespoke and never touches the lane, so the
reservation is left dangling — and within the scheduled-consumer TTL the NEXT
turn's wakeup is dropped as ``scheduled_consumer_fresh`` and silently never runs.

This module finalizes the reactive-event lane from the shared reactive-event door
(``BaseEntrypoint.run`` / ``BaseEntrypointWithEconomics.run``, around
``execute_core``). It is a STATE-CONDITIONAL, IDEMPOTENT invariant, NOT an
agent-type branch:

  * If the lane reservation is already released (consumer ``none``) and the turn's
    own event is already accounted for (consumed, or covered by the reactive
    cursor) → no-op. This is exactly the post-ReAct lane state, so a ReAct turn is
    inert here with no ``if react`` check.
  * Otherwise (a run-to-completion turn left it reserved) → release the consumer,
    mark the turn's own event consumed for exactly-once, and re-wake any reactive
    event that landed during the turn (a queued followup) so it promotes to the
    next turn.

It reuses the existing lane primitives only: the source's ``mark_consumed_up_to``
(the same exactly-once mark ``BaseWorkflow`` uses), the orchestrator's
``mark_consumer_none``, and the lane wake re-publish (the ``post_save`` mechanism).
