/**
 * Host-window coordination for the expand/collapse affordance, shared
 * idea with the stats `usage` and news `news_preview` widgets.
 *
 * When this chat UI is embedded as an iframe tile on the public landing
 * page, the expand control asks the host to promote the same iframe to a
 * fullscreen overlay (no reload, no re-fetch — the app keeps its state).
 * The widget never opens a fullscreen layer itself, since an iframe
 * cannot draw outside its own rectangle.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   widget -> host: { type: 'kdcube-widget-view', widget: '<chat-widget-id>',
 *                     view: 'compact' | 'expanded' }
 *   host -> widget: { type: 'kdcube-set-view', view: 'compact' | 'expanded' }
 *
 * Iframe sizing protocol:
 *   ?chat_embed_mode=host
 *
 * A host-composed scene sets this query parameter when it owns the iframe
 * rectangle. In that mode the widget fills the iframe and must not enter the
 * same-origin dev preview tile, even when the parent frame is readable.
 *
 * Auth handoff (public embedding): the chat renders for anonymous
 * visitors but sending requires a signed-in user. When an anonymous
 * visitor tries to send, the widget asks the host to show its own login
 * surface:
 *   widget -> host: { type: 'kdcube-auth-required', widget: '<chat-widget-id>' }
 * The host owns the login UI; the visitor may dismiss it and keep
 * reading. On success the host re-posts the runtime config with tokens
 * (CONFIG_RESPONSE, identity configured by the mounted bundle), which the
 * widget picks up to open the stream — no reload.
