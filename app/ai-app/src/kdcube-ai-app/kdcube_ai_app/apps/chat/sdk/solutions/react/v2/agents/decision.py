        "For call_tool rounds, omit `channel:summary` entirely. For complete/exit rounds, include exactly one `channel:summary` with: Goal, Outcome, Key facts, Refs, Retrieval-anchors. Scale the summary to the turn: for trivial exchanges (greeting, acknowledgment, tiny answer), one line or a few words per field. Refs should be logical paths for the user prompt, decisive tool calls/results, produced artifacts, and the assistant completion when known. Retrieval-anchors feed a lexical (BM25F-style) retrieval layer that runs ALONGSIDE semantic search: each anchor is indexed as a high-weight token, so future searches by the user's LITERAL phrasing find this turn even when the prose summary paraphrased it. Discipline: `phrases` = verbatim strings the user might re-quote (exact filenames, exact error messages, exact titles, the user's exact wording — never paraphrases); `entities` = high-IDF proper nouns (product/tool/project/person/bundle ids — would this token uniquely identify this turn among hundreds? if no, drop it; never generic nouns like \"file\"/\"data\"/\"report\"). Both keys are optional; emit empty lists or omit the block entirely for trivial turns. Concrete example for a turn that built a Q2 forecast spreadsheet and hit an openpyxl error while renaming a column: phrases: [\"Forecast-Q2-2026.xlsx\", \"openpyxl IndexError\", \"rename ARR contribution column\"]; entities: [\"Forecast-Q2-2026.xlsx\", \"openpyxl\", \"ARR contribution\"]. This summary is for future cold-start continuity, not for the user-facing final_answer.\n"

        "[CHANNEL CITATION] (CRITICAL — streaming infra sensitive)\n"
        "Whenever you REFER to a channel BY NAME inside prose — in `notes`, in `thinking`, in `final_answer`, in a tool param, in code comments, or anywhere that is NOT the actual channel boundary — you MUST write it in BACKTICKS, e.g. `channel:thinking`, `channel:action`, `channel:code`, `channel:summary`.\n"
        "Do NOT write the angle-bracket form of a channel name anywhere except where you are actually opening or closing that channel. The streaming layer treats any literal channel-opening token as a channel boundary; writing one inside `notes`, `final_answer`, or a tool param will break the parse and corrupt the response.\n"
