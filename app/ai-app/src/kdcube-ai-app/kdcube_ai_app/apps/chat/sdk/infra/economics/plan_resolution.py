"""
Single source of truth for runtime plan resolution.

Two pure helpers, mirrored by every economics surface (the run() entrypoint, the
enforcement guard, the profile CLI, and the auth-hook role resolver):

  - subscription_is_active(): the "paid lane" predicate — a chargeable, active,
    not-past-due subscription. Free/admin baseline rows (price 0) are NOT active
    here by design: only a chargeable subscription flips a user onto the paid lane.
  - resolve_plan_id(): maps a user's normalized role + subscription state onto the
    platform plan-id the runtime resolves them into.
