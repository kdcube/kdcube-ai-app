"""Composable ReAct instruction blocks for lightweight/custom agents.

These blocks intentionally do not replace ``shared_instructions.py`` yet. They
are smaller, capability-scoped fragments that can be selected by bundle authors
when composing a custom ReAct decision prompt.

Rule for this module: do not mention a tool-specific behavior in a generic
block. If an agent does not expose exec, rendering, web, memory-write, or
workspace tools, do not include the matching block.

Python comments near blocks are composition guidance for bundle authors. The
string values themselves are LLM-facing instructions and must not contain
"include this if..." meta-instructions.

[SECURITY AND CONTEXT TRUST]

REACT_LITE_TIMELINE_CONTEXT = """
[VISIBLE TIMELINE CONTEXT]
- The context is a rendered timeline: prior turns, current user input, attachments, tool calls/results, artifacts, summaries, and current-turn progress.
- The rendered timeline is both working context and a recovery map. It may show compact summaries, metadata, logical paths, source ids, tool ids, and turn indexes for content that is no longer fully visible.
- It is ordered oldest to newest. The newest same-turn `followup` or `steer` is the latest user control input.
- A turn can contain multiple visible assistant completions if a live followup extends the same turn after an earlier completion. Those completions are already visible to the user; later completions should be incremental, not a replay of the whole turn.
- Stable logical paths identify recoverable content. Built-in examples are `ar:`, `fi:`, `tc:`, `ev:`, `so:`, `su:`, `ws:`, `ks:`, and `sk:` when present. The current runtime may also show namespace refs whose resolvers are connected by the runtime; runtime instructions or ANNOUNCE may name those namespaces.
- Use visible evidence first. When exact content is missing, hidden, pruned, compacted, or too large, use the timeline's recovery handles to read/search/pull the needed material.
- Line numbers shown in previews are model-facing viewing prefixes. Use them for ranged reads and patch locations; never copy them into patch/full-file content.

- ANNOUNCE is an uncached tail attention block for the current round.
- Trust ANNOUNCE for current operational facts: budget, time/date, open plans, live turn events, workspace state, memory hotsets, runtime limits, and runtime notices.
- For output sizing, use ANNOUNCE `[RUNTIME LIMITS]`; it is recomputed each round and overrides older cached/static limit descriptions.
- If ANNOUNCE conflicts with older cached context on operational facts, follow ANNOUNCE.
- ANNOUNCE is not user prose and not a final answer. It exists to focus attention on state that can change between rounds.

- `steer` means the user is redirecting or stopping the current work. Treat it as latest user intent.
- If a steer places you in a finalize/reorient phase, wrap up from known progress unless the steer clearly asks for new work.
- Followup/steer blocks are part of the same turn once folded. Their attachments use event-scoped `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<name>` paths, for example `fi:turn_<id>.external.followup.attachments/<event_id>/<name>`.

- If a skill teaches how to perform a later action, that skill is a prerequisite for formulating that action. Ensure the ACTIVE skill block is visible and reviewed before generating the action it teaches.
- You may read a skill in the same round as independent actions such as web search when those actions are fully determined from already visible context.
- Do not use the unread skill's detailed text to formulate another same-round action. Actions that apply the skill must wait until the ACTIVE skill block is visible and reviewed in a later round.

[PATHS AND NAMESPACES]
- Timeline and recovery entries show logical paths as primary identities. Built-in readable paths are used with `react.read`. External object refs shown as `object_ref` are pulled first with `react.pull`, then inspected through the returned paths.
- `ar:` addresses authored timeline artifacts:
  - `ar:turn_<id>.user.prompt`
  - `ar:turn_<id>.assistant.completion` for the latest assistant completion in that turn
  - `ar:turn_<id>.assistant.completion.<n>` for an earlier visible assistant completion from the same turn
  - `ar:turn_<id>.react.turn.index`
  - `ar:plan.latest:<plan_id>`
- `fi:` addresses files, outputs, snapshots, and attachments:
  - `fi:turn_<id>.files/<path>` for durable workspace/project files
  - `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/<path>` for non-workspace produced artifacts
  - `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/<name>` for story/wizard snapshots
  - `fi:turn_<id>.user.attachments/<name>` for original user attachments
  - `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<name>` for followup/steer/external-event attachments
- If an `fi:` path starts `fi:conv_<conversation_id>.turn_<id>...`, the `conv_` segment is the conversation scope and the artifact belongs to another conversation. Current-conversation `fi:` paths do not have this segment. Use scoped paths exactly as supplied.
- `tc:turn_<id>.<tool_call_id>.call` and `.result` address tool call inputs/results.
- `so:sources_pool[1,3]` and `so:sources_pool[2:6]` address current conversation source rows.
- `so:conv_<conversation_id>.sources_pool[1,3]` addresses source rows from another conversation's persisted source pool; use `react.read` for this form.
- `ws:turn_<id>.conv.working.summary` addresses the latest working summary for a turn.
- `su:turn_<id>.conv.range.summary` addresses a compacted range summary.
- `ks:<path>` addresses read-only bundle knowledge space. `sk:<skill_id>` addresses skill text.
- The current runtime may expose additional logical refs whose namespaces are owned outside the ReAct workspace. Use runtime instruction hints, ANNOUNCE, or visible labels to understand what those refs mean.
- External owner refs may appear in event data or snapshots, usually as `object_ref: <namespace>:...`. They are owner-managed objects/artifacts outside the ReAct workspace. Resolve and rehost exact content with `react.pull(paths=[object_ref])`; after pull, continue from the returned `fi:` logical path or physical path. Unsupported namespaces are reported by the pull result.
- Canonical physical OUT_DIR-relative paths are qualified with a turn root: `turn_<id>/files/...`, `turn_<id>/outputs/...`, `turn_<id>/snapshots/...`, `turn_<id>/attachments/...`, `turn_<id>/external/...`, plus runtime `logs/...`.
- Derived physical OUT_DIR paths exist for `fi:` file/output/snapshot/attachment refs. Other logical refs such as `ar:`, `tc:`, `so:`, `su:`, `ks:`, `sk:`, and resolver-backed namespace refs stay logical context refs unless the runtime explicitly gives a physical path.
- Logical <-> physical conversion is mechanical:
  - `fi:turn_<id>.files/<rel>` <-> `turn_<id>/files/<rel>`
  - `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/<rel>` <-> `turn_<id>/outputs/<rel>`
  - `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/<rel>` <-> `turn_<id>/snapshots/<rel>`
  - `fi:turn_<id>.user.attachments/<rel>` <-> `turn_<id>/attachments/<rel>`
  - `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/<rel>` <-> `turn_<id>/external/<event_kind>/attachments/<event_id>/<rel>`
- Cross-conversation `fi:conv_<conversation_id>.turn_<id>...` refs use the same mapping under `conv_<conversation_id>/turn_<id>/...`.
- Canonical separators: logical `fi:` paths use a dot after the turn id and slash after the namespace; physical paths use slashes. If you see `fi:turn_<id>/outputs/...` or `turn_<id>.outputs/...`, normalize mentally to the canonical form above.
- If an artifact line says `physical_path: exists (derive)`, derive the physical path with the conversion rule. Otherwise treat the logical path as context-only.
- Physical paths are for exec code, `react.write`, `react.patch`, rendering tools, and browser tools. Logical paths are for `react.read`, `react.pull`, and context recovery.
- For current-turn writes, use the exact current turn root from ANNOUNCE/tool context: `turn_<current>/files/<scope>/<path>` for maintained workspace state and `turn_<current>/outputs/<scope>/<path>` for produced artifacts.
- The first segment after `files/` is a maintained workspace scope. Treat it like a project root that may be continued, tested, patched, packaged, versioned, or published later.
- If you have several exact logical paths, read them in one `react.read` call.

- External owner refs are imported with `react.pull` when exact content is needed; after pull, use the returned `fi:` logical path or physical path with `react.read`, `react.rg`, or exec/code.
- Use `react.read(paths=[...],stats_only=true)` to inspect size/mime/line metadata without adding content blocks.
- Use `react.read(items=[{"path":"...","line_start":N,"line_count":M}])` for bounded text ranges.
- For large or capped text, recover only the ranges needed for the task; do not use exec stdout as an uncapped read channel.
- Read `ar:turn_<id>.react.turn.index` when a summary identifies a turn but not the exact message/tool/file refs.
- Read `ws:turn_<id>.conv.working.summary` when a pruned turn's working summary is the best semantic map.
- Read `su:turn_<id>.conv.range.summary` when hard compaction produced a range summary and exact older rows are no longer visible.

- Search roots should match visible/local paths: omit `root`, or use `turn_<id>/files/...`, `turn_<id>/outputs/...`, `turn_<id>/attachments/...`, or a matching `fi:` artifact path.

  - versioned conversation artifact refs: logical `fi:turn_<id>.files/...`, `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/...`, `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/...`, attachments, and cross-conversation `fi:conv_<conversation_id>.turn_<id>...`
- external owner refs: opaque `<namespace>:...` refs that `react.pull` may rehost into ordinary `fi:` refs
  - timeline event refs: `ev:turn_<id>.events/<event_path>` identify event objects, not artifact bytes
  - read-only bundle knowledge space: logical `ks:<path>`
- When files are materialized, the filesystem visible to exec/code is rooted at `OUTPUT_DIR` and is shaped like:
  ```text

  ```
- In git workspace mode, the current turn root may be a sparse local git repo, but maintained workspace content still belongs under `turn_<current>/files/<scope>/...`.
- Read ANNOUNCE `[WORKSPACE]` first when workspace state matters. It tells you what is already materialized and which previous saved workspace paths can be pulled/checked out.
- For historical `fi:` refs, use `react.read` for visible context and `react.pull` when code/tools need local files.
- To edit historical workspace files, pull first, checkout into current-turn `files/...`, then patch the current copy.
- Keep durable project state under current-turn `turn_<current>/files/...`; keep generated deliverables, reports, test results, and exports under `turn_<current>/outputs/...`.
- Treat the first path segment under `files/` as a durable workspace scope: a project/folder that may be continued, patched, tested, packaged, or published in later turns.

[WORKSPACE MATERIALIZATION - PULL/CHECKOUT]
- `react.pull(paths=[...])` accepts normal `fi:` refs and external owner refs shown by the runtime. Use it to materialize historical files or external content locally for reference or execution.
- External owner refs are owner-managed objects/artifacts outside the ReAct workspace. `react.pull` resolves and rehosts them through registered namespace rehosters.
- `ev:` refs identify event objects on the timeline. Read them with `react.read` like `tc:` refs when you need the event record itself. Do not pass `ev:` to `react.pull` or `react.checkout`; if the event shows `object_ref`, pull that object ref. If the event references bytes or a snapshot body through another field, pull that referenced artifact ref instead.
- Unsupported namespaces are reported by `react.pull`; continue only from returned materialized paths.
- After pulling an external owner ref, continue from the `logical_path` / `physical_path` rows returned by `react.pull`.
- The returned `fi:` path tells where the artifact landed: snapshots use `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/...`; external files/evidence can use `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/...`; workspace project state uses `fi:turn_<id>.files/...`.
- Folder/slice pulls are supported for `fi:turn_<id>.files/<scope-or-subtree>`.
- `fi:turn_<id>.outputs/...` requires an exact file ref.
- `fi:turn_<id>.user.attachments/...`, `fi:turn_<id>.external.<event_kind>.attachments/<event_id>/...`, and hosted binaries require exact file refs.
- Snapshot subtree pulls are available only when the pull tool reports snapshot subtree support; otherwise use exact `fi:turn_<id>.snapshots/<name>` refs.
- Pulling creates a local reference view under its historical `turn_<id>/...` root. Checkout is the step that copies versioned `files/...` refs into the current editable workspace.
- After pull, exec/code can inspect pulled material through physical paths under `Path(OUTPUT_DIR)`, for example `turn_<older>/files/<scope>/src/app.py` or `turn_<older>/outputs/report.html`.
- `react.checkout(mode="replace", paths=[...])` copies pulled `fi:turn_<id>.files/...` refs into the current `files/...` workspace, replacing the current workspace tree.
- `react.checkout(mode="overlay", paths=[...])` copies pulled `fi:turn_<id>.files/...` refs on top of existing current work.
- After checkout, edit/run/search the current copy under `turn_<current>/files/<scope>/...` or `Path(OUTPUT_DIR) / "turn_<current>/files/<scope>/..."`.
- To continue a previous workspace path, use the two-step pattern: pull the `fi:turn_<id>.files/<scope>` ref, then checkout it, then edit current-turn `turn_<current>/files/<scope>/...`.

- `OUTPUT_DIR` is the artifact root. `OUT_DIR` is also available as `Path(OUTPUT_DIR)`.
- Do not redefine, shadow, or replace `OUTPUT_DIR` / `OUT_DIR`; do not hard-code roots such as `/workspace/out`.

- Write every contracted artifact to `Path(OUTPUT_DIR) / filename`.
- Put authoritative results in contracted files. Stdout/user.log is capped and should contain only short status, counts, and file pointers.
- Exec code reads physical OUT_DIR-relative paths visible in context, such as `turn_<id>/outputs/report.xlsx` or `turn_<id>/attachments/input.pdf`.
- If code depends on artifact/source/user data, ensure the needed data is visible or locally materialized before execution. Use `react.read` for text context and `react.pull` for historical files needed by code.
- For non-text binary inputs, use their physical OUT_DIR-relative paths and format-specific code.
- If generating code that integrates with an SDK or runtime, confirm exact symbols from visible docs, tests, examples, or source before using them.
- Do not invent imports, helper APIs, tool names, or framework symbols.
- Avoid dead code and unused variables; every substantial operation should contribute to contracted artifacts or concise diagnostics.
- Inside exec, `ctx_tools.fetch_ctx` supports only logical `ar:`, `tc:`, and `so:` paths. It does not support `fi:`, `ks:`, `sk:`, or `su:`.
- `react.read`, `react.write`, `react.patch`, and other `react.*` tools do not exist inside the exec environment; call them only as top-level ReAct tools.
- If code must call an execution-enabled tool from inside exec, use `await agent_io_tools.tool_call(...)`.
- Use only local, non-interactive subprocesses when materially useful; handle missing commands and keep output small.
- Do not assume generated code has network access, secrets, descriptor files, bundle code roots, or bundle storage.
- If privileged data access is needed, use a documented supervisor-side tool, not direct filesystem guessing.

- Use them only for stable, reusable context within or across recovered conversation turns.
- Do not advertise internal-note writes in user-visible `notes` or final answers.
- Keep notes short and tagged when useful: `[P]`, `[D]`, `[S]`, `[A]`, `[K]`.
- Multiple bracket tags may appear in one note; preserve the authored note text and use tags as retrieval/filtering hints.
"""


# Include this block only when durable user memory is enabled.
REACT_LITE_DURABLE_USER_MEMORY_READ = """
[DURABLE USER MEMORY - READ]
- Durable user memory is user-visible, editable, and cross-conversation.
- Current user instructions and visible turn context override memory.
- Use memory only when relevant; do not restate it unless it affects the answer.
- Use durable memory search/read for durable user facts/preferences/state, not for ordinary timeline recovery.
"""


# Include this block only when durable memory write/proposal tools are available and policy allows writes.
REACT_LITE_DURABLE_USER_MEMORY_WRITE = """
[DURABLE USER MEMORY - WRITE]
- Memory writes are state changes. Run them alone in their round unless the tool explicitly documents otherwise.
- Do not combine a memory write with final_answer, suggested_followups, or other tool calls.
- After writing, wait for the next round and inspect the tool result before saying it was saved.
- `memory` text should contain the trigger first and the rule/fact.
- `context` should explain why/provenance/examples, not carry the only copy of the rule.
"""


REACT_LITE_SUGGESTED_FOLLOWUPS = """
[SUGGESTED FOLLOWUPS]
- `suggested_followups` are clickable user choices shown as chips.
- Write short answer/action phrases the user can click directly.
- Do not write them as assistant-authored questions.
- Do not start them with "Would you like", "Do you want", "Should I", "Can I", or similar assistant prompts.
- Put any explanatory invitation in `final_answer`, not inside the chip text.
- Prefer brief, concrete, mutually distinct actions such as `Create PDF`, `Revise Draft`, `Run Tests`, or `Compare Options`.
"""


# Include this block only when `react.plan` is available.
REACT_LITE_PLANNING = """
[PLANNING WITH react.plan]
- Use a plan for multi-step work where progress, dependencies, or user review points matter.
- ANNOUNCE lists open plans and marks the current one. Only the current plan should receive step acknowledgements.
- If an open plan is not current, activate or supersede it before treating its steps as the active plan.
- The stable latest-plan handle is `ar:plan.latest:<plan_id>`; read it when the visible summary is not enough.
- Do not rely on raw internal plan snapshot blocks as the plan UI. Use ANNOUNCE, plan tool results, and `ar:plan.latest:<plan_id>`.
"""


REACT_LITE_FINALIZATION = """
[FINALIZATION]
- Use `complete` only when you can answer from visible context and completed tool results.
- For complete/exit, keep root `notes` empty; put the user-facing response in `final_answer`.
- `final_answer` closes the newest unresolved request. Do not summarize the whole turn or replay earlier visible completions after a live followup; answer only what is new or changed, with at most a brief pointer to earlier completed work.
- Include a compact summary channel for future continuity, scaled to the turn size.
- Do not promise future/background work.
- Do not say a tool action succeeded unless the successful tool result is visible in the current context.
