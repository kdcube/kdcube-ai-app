"""conv named-service provider wiring for this bundle.

Thin: constructs the SDK-owned conversation named-service provider so it is
discoverable and callable through this bundle's `named_services` MCP surface.
list/get/export use the SDK read facade, and search uses the SDK search backend —
both bound per request to the caller's tenant/project. All resources (pg_pool,
model service, conversation store) are passed in from above (the bundle worker's
pooled resources); nothing is inferred from router/app state. Identity, tenant and
project come per request from the named-service context.
