# ── platform/capabilities.py ── the per-turn, per-agent model-pick seam ──
#
# The chat component's Capabilities widget lets a user pick the answer model for a
# conversation. The pickable inventory + the saved selection are platform-owned
# (BaseEntrypoint serves `agent_capabilities` / `agent_selection_update`, backed by
# the UserAgentSelectionStore). This app declares the generic `simple_model_pick`
# provider PER AGENT in config (`surfaces.as_consumer.agents.lg-solution` /
# `.lg-react`), so the widget is active for each agent with zero adapter code.
#
# What stays app-side is the ONE thing that is framework-specific: HOW a saved pick
# is applied at runtime. Neither agent runs the ReAct node, so neither can reuse
# ReAct's `runtime_ctx.agent_role_models` seam. Instead this module resolves the
# pick for the ACTIVE (dispatched) agent, and `entrypoint.py` binds it onto
# `bundle_call_context.role_models` around that agent's graph run — the KDCube model
# router overlays it on that agent's answer role (`lg-solution.answer` /
# `lg-react.answer`), so the chosen model is used for that turn only. Everything
# fails open: any absence or error yields no override, and the router's configured
# default routes the turn.
