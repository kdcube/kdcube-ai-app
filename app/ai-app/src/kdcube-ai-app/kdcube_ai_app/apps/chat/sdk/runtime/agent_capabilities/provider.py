"""The agent-capabilities provider contract.

The chat component's Capabilities widget + per-user (per-conversation) selection
are agent-neutral: one inventory schema, one picker, one selection store. Only a
few pieces are framework-specific — the admin-allowed model list, which runtime
channel a chosen model rebases, and optional capabilities like skills/subagents.

An ``AgentCapabilitiesProvider`` is the seam that owns exactly those pieces for a
given agent implementation. ReAct is the first adapter; a generic model-pick
provider (``simple_model_pick``) is the reusable one every non-ReAct port declares
by config. Everything else — storage, MCP/named-service/realm/connected-account
enrichment, deny-list narrowing, the picker UI — stays shared and untouched.
