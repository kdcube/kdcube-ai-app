"""Agent-neutral composition of an instruction body from config tokens.

One vocabulary, shared by any agent that composes its instruction body from a
configured list (a profile's ``blocks``, or ``instruction_blocks``). Each item
is resolved independently and all are joined with a blank line **in the order
listed**:

- ``full`` (optionally ``full:<anything>``) → the agent's complete default body,
  supplied by the caller through ``full_body_provider``. The full set is
  monolithic (not capability-scoped), so any suffix is ignored. With no provider
  a ``full`` token contributes nothing.
- ``lite:<profile>`` → a whole moderate profile body (``core``, ``workspace``,
  ``workspace_exec``, ``document``, ``web``, ``all_capabilities``).
- ``xlite:<profile>`` → a whole extra-lite profile body (same profile names).
- ``REACT_LITE_*`` / ``REACT_XLITE_*`` → a single named block.
- anything else → literal instruction text, used verbatim.

This module owns only the vocabulary. The agent's full/default body is injected
(``full_body_provider``) so nothing here is agent-specific; the ReAct harness,
or any other agent, wraps this with its own default-body builder. The runtime
protocol and tool/skill catalogs are added by the agent around this body, not
here.

Direction: this package is the seam for externally-managed, versioned
instruction sets — a block/profile referenced by name here will resolve, in
time, from a managed store (with an id and a version) rather than only from the
in-tree ``shared_instructions_lite`` / ``instructions_extra_lite`` registries.
Keep the resolution behind this composer so that move needs no caller change.
