# Scene Widget Composition Fixes

## Context

The active Versatile main view was moved to `ui/scene` so the reference bundle
can compose reusable SDK components:

- chat widget: `sdk://solutions/chat/ui/widget`
- memory widget: `sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories`
- canvas component: `sdk://solutions/canvas/ui/component`

Initial testing showed the scene mounted the pieces, but the UX was not stable:
the memory widget could collapse into a tiny line, expanded memories stretched
like a page instead of a useful panel, the scene had a redundant reconnect
button, canvas and chat controls did not match the task-tracker pattern, and
chat width could not be resized.

## Fixes Made

### Host Owns Widget Geometry

The scene now owns widget panel geometry. Embedded widgets must not be allowed
to resize the scene implicitly through iframe resize messages.

Changes:

- replaced the old two-row right column with a stable chat side panel;
- moved memory into a floating overlay panel;
- made memory panel position host-controlled;
- kept iframe dimensions at `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` inside the host
  panel.

Scene composition rule:

```text
scene host controls panel size and placement
  -> iframe/component fills that panel
  -> iframe may request compact/expanded state
  -> iframe does not own host geometry
```

### Right Rail Controls

The scene now follows the task-tracker interaction model:

- chat button on the right rail;
- canvas button on the right rail;
- memory button on the right rail.

The scene-level "Reconnect chat" button was removed. Connection recovery is a
chat-widget responsibility and already belongs inside the chat widget.

### Chat Resize

The chat side panel now has a left resize handle like task-tracker:

```text
drag chat left edge left  -> wider chat
drag chat left edge right -> narrower chat
```

The scene stores the width in `--versatile-chat-width` and clamps it to a
usable range.

### Memory Overlay Behavior

Memory is no longer placed as a second row below chat. It is opened on demand as
a floating panel because the intended workflow is usually:

```text
open memories
  -> find/select memory
  -> drag memory to chat or canvas
  -> close memories
```

The memory overlay is draggable in compact and expanded states. Expanded memory
is a large movable work panel, not a viewport-pinned page.

The memory overlay opens over the canvas workspace by default, not over the
chat column. This keeps chat readable while memories are used as a transient
source for dragging objects to canvas or chat.

The host scene owns overlay chrome: expand/compact and close buttons live in
the host panel header. The embedded memory widget receives `host_controls=1`,
so compact widget chrome does not render a second expand button.

### Memory Expanded Content

The memory widget itself no longer shows reconciliation/maintenance by default
in expanded mode. Maintenance is still available, but behind an explicit
"Show maintenance" button.

This keeps the default expanded view focused on:

- filters;
- memory list;
- memory detail/editor.

The memory detail/editor panel is now conditional. It is rendered only when a
memory is selected or an editor is active. Without that guard, the shared memory
widget reserved an empty right-side panel and made both the task-tracker and
Versatile expanded memory views look like they had a large dead area.

The memory widget emits memory-owned drag events (`kdcube.memory.drag.start`,
`kdcube.memory.drag.end`) and a memory context payload (`kdcube.memory.context`).
It must not emit task-tracker-specific messages. Consumers that need memory
objects listen for the memory event or read the generic `contexts[]` shape from
the drag payload.

Compact memory controls use this split:

- `+` means add a memory note;
- expand/compact arrows belong to the host overlay header;
- close belongs to the host overlay header.

When `host_controls=1` is set, the memory iframe suppresses its own compact
header controls. The host panel header becomes the single chrome row:

```text
---------------- memory host header ----------------+
| Memories  2 in scope                 +  expand  x |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

The `+` button stays styled as a primary teal action and sends a
memory-owned command to the iframe:

```json
{
  "type": "kdcube-memory-widget-command",
  "widget": "memories",
  "action": "create"
}
```

The memory widget also publishes a small status event to the parent so the
host can render the scope count without reimplementing memory list logic:

```json
{
  "type": "kdcube-memory-widget-status",
  "widget": "memories",
  "count": 2,
  "compact": true
}
```

Memory rows now cap visible chips instead of rendering every label/keyword in
the row. Compact rows show a few terms, full rows show a bounded set, and the
remaining count is represented by a `+N` chip. This prevents narrow memory
columns from slicing through chips or making the item height unpredictable.

The memory overlay drag handler also disables iframe pointer events while the
host panel is being moved and cleans up on pointer-up, pointer-cancel, or
window blur. This avoids the "panel sticks to the cursor" failure caused by a
lost pointer-up when the cursor crosses an iframe.

### Canvas Styling and Sizing

The canvas component is still mounted as a shared source into the scene. The
host scene keeps the canvas in a dedicated workspace panel and the panel keeps
stable height so the canvas grid, cards, and bottom actions remain usable.

The scene keeps the canvas workspace shell mounted even when the user hides the
canvas. Hiding the canvas swaps its content for an empty-state panel instead of
removing the grid column. This prevents the chat widget and right rail from
moving into the center of the scene when the canvas is closed.

Scene CSS also provides the common canvas host rules that the SDK component
expects, including `.sr-only` for file inputs and button styles for
`.canvas-actions`. Missing these host rules exposed the browser-native
"no file chosen" text and made SDK canvas controls look unstyled.

The canvas component root is explicitly assigned to the body row of the canvas
shell. Without that rule, an empty canvas with no notice banner could collapse
to header height and look uninitialized.

Canvas mutations in this scene use the generic `canvas.patch` Data Bus subject.
The server handler must propagate Data Bus scope into the canvas operation
payload:

```python
payload.setdefault("tenant", ctx.tenant)
payload.setdefault("project", ctx.project)
payload.setdefault("user_id", message.actor.get("user_id"))
```

This matters because Data Bus messages carry tenant/project on the message
envelope, while actor metadata carries user/fingerprint/roles. If the handler
only copies actor fields, canvas store creation may fall back to default scope
or fail before creating the revision.

SDK components that need storage scope should use the shared
`BaseEntrypoint.runtime_identity()` helper rather than copying a private helper
from another bundle.

Canvas object actions now log both sides of the resolver path:

```text
browser: [versatile:canvas] object action request/response
server:  [canvas.object_action] requested/resolved/failed
```

The server log includes action, namespace, resolver, resolver status, object
ref, user id, story id, whether a downloadable payload was returned, and
whether a UI open event was returned. The canvas UI no longer reports
`Download prepared` unless `content_base64` exists in the resolver response.

Memory card `open` uses the memory resolver result:

```json
{
  "ui_event": {
    "target_surface": "sdk.memory.viewer",
    "memory_id": "mem_..."
  }
}
```

The scene host translates that into the same memory-owned widget command:

```json
{
  "type": "kdcube-memory-widget-command",
  "widget": "memories",
  "action": "open",
  "memory_id": "mem_..."
}
```

The host keeps one pending memory command and flushes it when the iframe loads,
so opening a memory from a canvas card does not depend on whether the memory
panel was already mounted.

The scene still uses current explicit Vite shared-source glue. This is a
reference integration detail, not the desired final developer ergonomics.

## Lessons for SDK Documentation

### Component Requirements

A reusable widget/component intended for scene composition should support:

| Requirement | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| compact and expanded view messages | Host owns fullscreen/large-panel state. |
| stable iframe fill layout | Widget fills the host frame and does not resize the host. |
| context drag messages | Host can broker dropped objects to chat/canvas. |
| owner-specific resolver handoff | Widget can expose object refs without embedding transport details. |
| internal reconnect controls for live transports | Host should not duplicate chat transport controls. |

### Scene Host Requirements

A scene that composes widgets should provide:

| Requirement | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| owned geometry for every panel | Prevent iframe resize feedback loops. |
| right rail for primary surfaces | Consistent with task-tracker UI. |
| draggable overlays for transient tools | Memory/canvas helpers should not permanently consume layout. |
| explicit fullscreen/expanded handling | Widget requests state; host applies state. |
| stable message broker | Context, view, and auth messages move between iframes and platform. |

## Verification

Build checks run after the fixes:

```bash
OUTDIR=/private/tmp/versatile-scene-build npm run build
OUTDIR=/private/tmp/memory-widget-build npm run build
```

Both builds passed.
