# Ported LangGraph Agents Interface

`ported-langgraph-agents@2026-07-13` hosts **two** ported LangGraph agents
(`lg-solution` = a research graph with a dedicated answer node; `lg-react` = the
prebuilt `create_react_agent` with a looping agent node), both vendored unchanged
under `solution/`, dispatched by `agent_id` through a **single `execute_core`**. It
exposes **two ingresses that drive that same turn**:

1. **the reactive chat turn** — a browser message on the KDCube chat surface,
   dispatched on `agent_id` to the right agent;
2. **the Telegram Bot API webhook** — `POST /public/telegram_webhook`, a Telegram
   message routed into the same turn (the **default agent**) and answered back over
   the Bot API.

The machine-readable contract is
[ported-langgraph-agents.openapi.yaml](ported-langgraph-agents.openapi.yaml) (the
webhook under `paths`, both surfaces under `x-kdcube-surfaces`); this README is the
human contract.

## Surface 1: the reactive chat turn (agent_id dispatch)

The KDCube chat surface delivers each user message as a reactive event. The base
entrypoint's `run()` calls `execute_core(state, thread_id, params)`, which resolves
the active agent and runs it:

```text
turn in
  user text  ->  state["external_events"]  ->  external_events_text(...)
  agent_id   ->  state["agent_id"]  ->  AGENTS[agent_id]  (else the default, lg-solution)

turn out (streamed live to the reusable chat component via comm_ctx, through the
          ACTIVE agent's OWN stream adapter)
  graph node start / tool run   ->  comm_ctx.step(name, "running")
  answer tokens                 ->  comm_ctx.delta(token, marker="answer")
  graph node / tool end         ->  comm_ctx.step(name, "completed")
  end of turn                   ->  comm_ctx.complete(data={"final_answer": ...})
                                    and state["final_answer"] = <answer>
```

- `lg-solution` streams the tokens of its **dedicated answer node**
  (`platform/stream_solution.py`).
- `lg-react` streams only the **final turn of its looping agent node** and
  surfaces each `tools` run as a step (`platform/stream_prebuilt.py`).

`state["final_answer"]` is the platform's canonical answer; the platform-owned
conversation record persists it so chat list / fetch / reload work for either agent.

Economic enforcement is a **cross-cutting guard on this same chat turn**, not a new
surface: the turn-level budget preflight + rate limiter (from
`BaseEntrypointWithEconomics`) run inside `run()` before `execute_core`, and a
per-call budget check guards lg-solution's retrieval/memory embeddings. A denial
surfaces on the stream as a `rate_limit.*` service event, not a separate endpoint.

## Surface 2: the Telegram Bot API webhook

A public HTTP webhook that drives the **same** turn for the **default agent**. It is
declared once as `@api(route="public", method="POST", alias="telegram_webhook")` and
delegates every mechanic to the reusable Telegram SDK
(`kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.telegram`); the bundle-side wiring is the
thin `platform/telegram.py`.

```text
Telegram Bot API  --POST /public/telegram_webhook?integration_id=telegram.default-->
  SDK verifies X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token  (missing/wrong -> 401)
  SDK claims update_id (dedupe) + resolves the Telegram sender
    -> platform identity user = telegram_<telegram_user_id>
  SDK drives the SAME turn (execute_core) for the DEFAULT agent
  identity.py isolates telegram_<id>'s memory (folded with the active agent id)
  SDK renders the answer + streamed progress back over the Bot API
```

`route="public"` only means the route is reachable without platform auth. The
**trust boundary is the Telegram webhook secret**, verified by the SDK before any
work. The webhook only routes and renders; the turn (`execute_core`) is unchanged
and shared by both surfaces.

External setup (creating the bot, the token, the webhook secret, and calling
`setWebhook`) happens outside the code — see
[../docs/integrations/admin-integrational-homework.md](../docs/integrations/admin-integrational-homework.md).

This app declares no further surface: no MCP server (`@mcp`), no widget
(`@ui_widget`) — it reuses the chat component and ships no UI — no Data Bus handler,
cron, or background job.

## The isolation boundary (per agent)

The same process serves many users across many tenants/projects — AND hosts both
agents. `identity.py` maps the platform identity + the ACTIVE `agent_id` onto each
agent's per-user keys:

```text
platform state + agent_id        agent key
  tenant + project + AGENT + user  ->  user_id   = "{tenant}:{project}:{agent}:{user}"
  user_id + conversation           ->  thread_id = "{user_id}:{conversation}"
```

The same raw user id under lg-solution and lg-react resolves to DIFFERENT keys,
so the two agents' memories never mix. Anonymous callers fall back to `fingerprint`,
then `"anonymous"`; a blank agent id folds to `default`.

## The storage boundary (per agent)

Each agent keeps its **own** store — routed onto KDCube's shared Postgres in its own
per-agent schema when hosted, its own `DATABASE_URL` standalone (external /
read-through from KDCube's view). The platform owns the **conversation record**
(the app writes none). See [../docs/storage/README.md](../docs/storage/README.md).

## Config and secret keys that control this app

Non-secret deploy config (see [../config/bundles.template.yaml](../config/bundles.template.yaml)):

- `surfaces.as_provider.bundle.default_chat` — the reactive chat surface (surface 1).
- `surfaces.as_consumer.default_agent` (`lg-solution`) + `agents.lg-solution` /
  `agents.lg-react` — each declares a `simple_model_pick` picker on its own role.
- `tools.mode` — lg-react's tools seam (plain | mcp | both).
- `enabled.api.public.telegram_webhook.POST` — enables surface 2.
- `integrations.telegram.default` — the Telegram integration (`enabled: false` by
  default).

Deploy secret keys (see [../config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml](../config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml)):

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — the agents' model. Absent → the offline stub.
- `DATABASE_URL` — the agents' own Postgres, used on the standalone path.
- `integrations.telegram.default.definition.bot_token` / `webhook_secret` — the Bot
  API credential + the shared secret the SDK verifies.

The chat component's Capabilities model picker is active per agent. The
`agent_capabilities` / `agent_selection_update` operations are inherited platform
ops (served by `BaseEntrypoint`), not declared in this app's manifest; the app turns
the picker on by declaring `simple_model_pick` under each agent. A user's
per-conversation pick is applied per turn for the ACTIVE agent by binding its answer
role onto `bundle_call_context.role_models`. See [../docs/README.md](../docs/README.md).

## Runtime notes

- Each agent's graph is built lazily on the first turn that dispatches to it (its
  checkpointer needs an event loop) and reused across turns/users; every turn is
  keyed per (agent, user, conversation), so one graph per agent serves everyone
  safely.
- The app hard-requires only `langgraph`, which the processor environment already
  provides. Each agent degrades if the optional Postgres checkpointer / `psycopg` v3
  are absent. For a hardened deploy that pins the full dependency set, use the
  `@venv` contract with [../requirements.txt](../requirements.txt).
