"""Agentic configuration — agents configured, extended, reconfigured, tuned.

The solutions-level home for agent configuration as a first-class, managed
artifact: instruction sets are authored, stored with an id and a version,
and reattached to agents as quickly as tools and skills connect and
disconnect. Submodules own one concern each:

- ``instructions`` — the composition vocabulary, the ``instr:`` ref grammar,
  the versioned store, and the async ref expansion.

Runtime resolution (profile picks, rosters) stays in
``runtime/agent_inventory.py``; this package owns authoring, storage, and
presentation of the configuration itself.
