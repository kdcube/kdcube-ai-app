# lg-react's tools are DECLARED as a connection list under
# `surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<id>.tools` — the SAME standard KDCube shape the
# capabilities catalog reads (like the workspace `main` agent). That declaration is
# the ADMIN CEILING and drives the picker natively: the `agent_capabilities` op
# lists the tools, the widget renders per-tool toggles, and a user's opt-outs are
# stored as a deny-map (`disabled.tools.<alias>: true | [names]`) by the platform.
#
# This module is the RUNTIME half (approach B — "reuse the declaration"): it reads
# the declared ceiling and, given the user's saved deny-map, binds EXACTLY the
# bundle's own LangChain @tool objects the admin allowed AND the user left enabled.
# No tool-subsystem load here — the tool manager can be adopted later for anything
# the declaration alone can't express (per-tool runtime, SK discovery); for now the
# declaration is enough to make the tools pickable.
#
# Ceiling semantics: a tool the admin does NOT declare is never bound (hard off);
# a declared tool is on by default and the user can opt out per conversation.
