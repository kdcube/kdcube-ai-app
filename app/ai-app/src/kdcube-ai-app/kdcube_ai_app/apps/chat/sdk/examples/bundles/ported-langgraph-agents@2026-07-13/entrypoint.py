# ── entrypoint.py ── composition root ── ONE app, MANY agents ──
#
# This app hosts TWO ported LangGraph agents behind a SINGLE `execute_core`,
# dispatched by `agent_id`:
#
#   - `lg-solution` — the preserved research graph under
#     `solution/lg_solution/` (KB retrieval + per-user pgvector memory + a nested
#     subagent). Linear shape with a DEDICATED answer node, so its stream adapter
#     (platform/stream_solution.py) streams that node's tokens.
#   - `lg-react` — the `langchain.agents.create_agent` solution under
#     `solution/lg_prebuilt/` (plain + MCP tools). Its `model` node LOOPS
#     (once per tool-decision cycle) with no dedicated answer node, so its stream
#     adapter (platform/stream_prebuilt.py) streams ONLY the final model turn.
#
# Both solution packages preserve their framework/domain boundaries from the
# standalone "before" (poc/lg-solution, poc/lg-prebuilt-agent). Deliberate async,
# configuration, model-injection, package-import, and prompt-composition seams are
# explicit. The platform integration is:
#
#   1. a dispatcher      — execute_core resolves agent_id and runs the right graph
#                          through its own stream adapter (the teaching point:
#                          different agent shapes -> different stream adapters,
#                          selected by agent_id)
#   2. scaled serving    — this app builds a fresh graph bound to each turn's
#                          model/tool choices. Durable state lives in shared Postgres
#                          (checkpointer, keyed by thread_id); only connections are
#                          long-lived on self.
#   3. isolation         — platform identity + agent_id -> per-agent per-user keys
#                          (platform/identity.py), plus one tenant/project schema
#                          with app-prefixed tables and agent_id row scope
#   4. streaming         — astream_events -> comm_ctx (the two stream adapters)
#   5. a shared ingress  — a Telegram Bot API webhook (platform/telegram.py) that
#                          drives the SAME execute_core for the DEFAULT agent
#
# Persistence is mapped by DATA KIND (see docs/storage/README.md): each agent's OWN
# working store (memory/KB + the LangGraph checkpointer) is routed onto KDCube's
# SHARED Postgres (self.pg_pool) in the ONE tenant/project schema when hosted,
# with app-prefixed tables and agent_id row scope; it uses its own
# DATABASE_URL standalone, in-memory offline. KDCube owns the conversation record.

    consume in-turn followups/steers (a mid-turn followup is promoted to the next
    turn). Each is streamed to the reusable chat component, isolated per (agent,
    user, conversation), and recorded by the platform-owned conversation log.

    Economic ENFORCEMENT (T2b) closes the backend loop on top of T2a accounting:
      - Turn-level — deriving `BaseEntrypointWithEconomics` wraps every turn in the
