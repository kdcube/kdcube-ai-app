# ── entrypoint.py ── composition root ── ONE app, MANY agents ──
#
# This app hosts TWO ported LangGraph agents behind a SINGLE `execute_core`,
# dispatched by `agent_id`:
#
#   - `lg-solution` — the rich research graph vendored under
#     `solution/lg_solution/` (KB retrieval + per-user pgvector memory + a nested
#     subagent). Linear shape with a DEDICATED answer node, so its stream adapter
#     (platform/stream_solution.py) streams that node's tokens.
#   - `lg-react` — the standard `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent` vendored
#     under `solution/lg_prebuilt/` (plain + MCP tools). Its `agent` node LOOPS
#     (once per tool-decision cycle) with no dedicated answer node, so its stream
#     adapter (platform/stream_prebuilt.py) streams ONLY the final agent turn.
#
# Both agents' graph structure and logic are UNCHANGED from their standalone
# "before" (poc/lg-solution, poc/lg-react-agent). The platform integration is:
#
#   1. a dispatcher      — execute_core resolves agent_id and runs the right graph
#                          through its own stream adapter (the teaching point:
#                          different agent shapes -> different stream adapters,
#                          selected by agent_id)
#   2. a per-agent graph cache — each agent's graph is built lazily once per process
#                          and reused (stateless: state per turn via thread_id)
#   3. isolation         — platform identity + agent_id -> per-agent per-user keys
#                          (platform/identity.py) AND a per-agent storage schema
#                          (platform/pg_target.py), so the two agents never mix
#   4. streaming         — astream_events -> comm_ctx (the two stream adapters)
#   5. a shared ingress  — a Telegram Bot API webhook (platform/telegram.py) that
#                          drives the SAME execute_core for the DEFAULT agent
#
# Persistence is mapped by DATA KIND (see docs/storage/README.md): each agent's OWN
# working store (memory/KB + the LangGraph checkpointer) is routed onto KDCube's
# SHARED Postgres (self.pg_pool) in a PER-AGENT schema when hosted, its own
# DATABASE_URL standalone, in-memory offline. KDCube owns the conversation record.
