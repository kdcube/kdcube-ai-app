# ── identity.py ── the shared multi-tenant + multi-agent isolation gate ──
#
# Each vendored agent ran on one machine for one person: its CLI passed
# `--user alice` and that raw string keyed both the per-user store and the
# checkpointer thread. Hosted by KDCube, the SAME process serves many users
# across many tenants/projects concurrently — AND this one app now hosts TWO
# agents (`lg-solution`, `lg-react`) dispatched by `agent_id`. If the platform
# layer forwarded a raw or constant id, two platform users would share state, and
# worse, the two agents' memories could mix.
#
# So this gate maps the PLATFORM identity onto each agent's per-user + per-
# conversation keys AND folds the ACTIVE agent_id into them, so the two agents'
# memories can never collide even though they share a store. (Storage rows are
# also tagged with the scope columns tenant/project/bundle_id/agent_id — see
# pg_target.py — so the store filters `WHERE agent_id = …`; this fold is the
# belt-and-suspenders key-level guarantee.) Kept separate so the isolation rule is
# explicit and testable rather than buried in execute_core.

      identity AND the active ``agent_id``, so the same raw user id in two
      tenants/projects — or the same user across the two agents — never collides.
      (Storage rows are additionally tagged with an ``agent_id`` column, so the two
      agents stay apart at the row level too.)
    - ``thread_id`` keys an agent's LangGraph checkpointer, i.e. the conversation.
      It is scoped by ``user_id`` (which already carries the agent), so a shared or
      anonymous conversation id can never let one user's — or one agent's — graph
      state resume into another's.
