# Connection Hub App

`connection-hub@1-0` is the user-scoped hub for connection edges and delegated
account connections.

It answers three related questions:

```text
Who is this external identity in KDCube?
  -> connection edge -> platform user id -> platform principal/role resolver

Can this incoming request prove one of those external identities?
  -> request authenticator -> connection edge -> UserSession authority

Which user ids belong to the same linked identity family?
  -> Connection Hub resolver -> platform authority + provider identities

Can automation use this user's external account?
  -> connected account -> delegated token/claim
```

The app exposes request authenticators so ingress and app/channel handlers can
verify Telegram/webhook/API-key style requests without duplicating proof logic.
It also exposes the public `connections` named-service provider so any app acting
for the current user can resolve that user's connection tokens without owning the
OAuth mechanics itself. It also exposes connection-edge operations so a verified
external identity can resolve to a platform principal envelope, and a resolver
operation so aggregation surfaces can get canonical linked user ids server-side.

The app wires four building blocks:

- connection-edge storage and a temporary principal-resolution fixture;
- identity-family resolver for linked user-id expansion;
- request authenticators, currently Telegram Mini App/WebApp `initData`;
- the reusable `integrations/connections` mechanics (`ConnectionStore`,
  `ConnectionsProviderBase`, the connection registry of `ConnectionProvider`s);
- the reusable `integrations/email` settings (**iCloud** app-password only —
  Gmail is a connections provider), exposed through its own `email_*` ops; and
- a `connections_settings` browser widget served from `ui/widgets/connections`.

## Identity model

```text
external proof from a channel/provider
  provider="google"   subject="person@example.com"
  provider="telegram" subject="314062490"
  provider="bundle"   subject="some-app:external-user-77"
        |
        v
Connection Hub connection edge
        |
        v
platform principal/role resolver
        |
        v
platform_user_id + roles/permissions
```

Connection Hub should not be the long-term role authority. Its local
`identity.role_bindings` config is only a development fixture. Real entitlements
must come from a platform principal/role resolver after identity resolution.

## Request-authenticator model

```text
gateway/app request
  -> request_authenticate(RequestEnvelope)
  -> configured authenticator verifies provider proof
  -> connection edge resolves provider:<subject>
  -> platform authority is projected into identity_authority
  -> gateway turns result into UserSession
```

Telegram is the first provider-family implementation. Multiple bots can be
configured as descriptor rows under `identity.authenticators[]` or as
widget-managed Postgres metadata rows. Each row references a secret key in
`bundles.secrets.yaml`; secret values are never stored in the metadata row.
Each app/provider surface has stable non-secret authority/authenticator ids.
Controlled app surfaces, such as the Versatile Telegram Mini App, read those ids
from app config and send `X-KDCube-Auth-Authority-ID` and
`X-KDCube-Auth-Authenticator-ID` beside the provider proof. If a request names
an authenticator id, Connection Hub tries only that row and fails closed if it
is not configured.

`role_providing` marks authenticators that directly prove platform authority.
Telegram bots normally keep it `false`: Telegram proves the actor, then the
connection edge supplies platform roles.

### Proof-based Telegram linking

First-time Telegram linking needs two proofs in one flow: a platform-authenticated
browser session and a Telegram-signed Mini App session.

```text
Platform-first:
  KDCube browser session
  -> connections_settings creates short-lived challenge for platform_user_id
  -> user opens the provider proof surface that owns the desired Telegram bot
  -> that Telegram Mini App sends signed initData to Connection Hub
  -> Connection Hub validates initData and completes:
       telegram:<telegram_user_id> -> platform_user_id

Telegram-first:
  user opens a Telegram Mini App from Telegram
  -> host app embeds the Connection Hub widget in an iframe
  -> host app passes opaque authContext.headers through CONFIG_RESPONSE
  -> Connection Hub widget sends signed initData to Connection Hub
  -> Connection Hub creates pending provider proof with no platform_user_id
  -> Connection Hub widget claims a short-lived connection-hub Socket.IO session
  -> user opens returned platform_claim_url
  -> standalone claim page uses /api/cp-frontend-config to sign into KDCube
  -> connections_settings claims the proof for the current platform user
  -> Connection Hub emits connection_hub.edge.changed to the iframe
  -> Connection Hub completes:
       telegram:<telegram_user_id> -> platform_user_id
```

The Telegram request never sends or chooses `platform_user_id`; it only proves
the Telegram account. The platform user is either server-side on the
platform-first challenge or supplied by the authenticated KDCube claim request
in the Telegram-first flow.

The Telegram-first flow is evented, not polled. The embedded Connection Hub
widget creates its own app-scoped live channel with `federated_data_bus_claim`.
`telegram_connection_edge_start` stores that live session id on the pending
challenge. When the browser-side claim completes, Connection Hub emits a
targeted `connection_hub.edge.changed` service event to that session,
and the iframe refreshes its linked/unlinked state.

## Three-level connection model

```text
provider            connector app                    user account
(OAuth mechanics)   (credentials, MANY per provider) (one user token, records connector_app_id)
  slack       ->      connector_app_id=acme-search  --->  account_id (workspace) + token
  slack       ->      connector_app_id=other-app    ---->  ...
```

- **Provider** = OAuth mechanics only, no credentials. Providers are DYNAMIC —
  driven by the connection registry (any registered `ConnectionProvider`).
  Importing the providers package registers the built-ins (Slack, …).
- **Connector app** = the OAuth application client or credential class that carries credentials. Deploy
  config populates these, MANY per provider, under
  `connections.delegated_to_kdcube.providers.<provider>.connector_apps`.
  Each connector app's `client_secret` is supplied separately as a deploy secret
  when the provider uses OAuth.
- **User account** = connected THROUGH one connector app; the account record stores
  its `connector_app_id`. Tokens are user-scoped, so any
  bundle acting for that user can resolve them.

The OAuth callback is a single hub-level route shared by all providers/apps:
`…/connection-hub@1-0/public/delegated_to_kdcube_oauth_callback`, signed by
`connections.delegated_to_kdcube.oauth_state_secret`.

## Email integration

**Gmail and Slack ride delegated to KDCube** (OAuth) through
`delegated_to_kdcube_start_oauth` + the shared
`delegated_to_kdcube_oauth_callback`. **iCloud** uses the same delegated-to-KDCube
broker through `delegated_to_kdcube_connect_credential`, because
it is app-password based rather than OAuth based.

A server-side caller resolves the user's external credential through the
delegated to KDCube broker. It returns an unavailable result if that user has
not connected the requested provider/account.

kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.solutions.connections.hub
  provider_impl.py          # ConnectionHubProvider (connections provider)
  connection_edges.py         # connection edges, link challenges, principal fixture

  authenticators.py         # request-authenticator modules
  authenticator_store.py    # request-authenticator metadata store
```

## Runtime notes

- On `on_bundle_load` the app registers its named-service providers into Redis
  discovery (`bundle_registry` transport) for this tenant/project, so other
  apps can discover the `connections` provider.
- Connection tokens are user-scoped state in app storage; they are never put in
  descriptor templates.
- Identity links are also user-scoped state in app storage. They link a
  verified external identity to a platform user; they do not grant roles by
  themselves.
- The static widget is built from `ui/widgets/connections`; the runtime must be
  refreshed so the new app loads and the widget is built.
