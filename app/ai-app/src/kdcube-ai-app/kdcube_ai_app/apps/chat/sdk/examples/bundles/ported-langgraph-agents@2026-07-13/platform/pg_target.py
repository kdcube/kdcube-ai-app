#
# This is where each vendored agent's OWN store stops being single-machine and
# becomes hosted-at-scale — the non-hosted → hosted STORAGE transition.
#
# Each standalone agent keeps all its mutable state in its OWN Postgres
# (`DATABASE_URL`): lg-solution's per-user pgvector `memories` + seeded KB, and
# each agent's LangGraph checkpointer (per-conversation graph state). Hosted by
# KDCube, that same store is routed onto KDCube's SHARED Postgres (`self.pg_pool`'s
# database), into the ONE per-tenant/project schema `kdcube_{tenant}_{project}`
# that `conv_index` / `UserMemoryStore` already use. Every mutable byte then lives
# in shared Postgres, tagged by SCOPE COLUMNS — so the hosted app holds nothing
# per-turn in-process and any processor worker can serve any turn (stateless,
# distributed-safe).
#
# SCHEMA MODEL (the canonical KDCube pattern): there is exactly ONE schema per
# tenant/project — `kdcube_{tenant}_{project}`. It is NOT per-agent, NOT per-bundle,
# NOT per-version. The bundle's tables are bundle-prefixed NAMES inside that shared
# schema (`ported_langgraph_agents_memories`, `ported_langgraph_agents_kb`). The
# platform's PostgresSetup job provides the `vector` / `pg_trgm` / `pgcrypto`
# extensions, so the bundle only ever `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` +
# `CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` — it never provisions an extension itself.
#
# ISOLATION IS BY COLUMN, NOT SCHEMA: every row is tagged with the scope
# `(tenant, project, bundle_id, agent_id, user_id)` and every read filters on it.
# This one app hosts two agents, `lg-solution` and `lg-react`; their rows share the
# same table and stay apart via the `agent_id` COLUMN. Combined with the identity
# gate folding agent_id into the per-user key, the two agents' state can never mix.
#
# The ONLY selection is this injection point — there is no runtime toggle:
#
#   1. pg_pool present  ->  KDCube shared Postgres + tenant/project schema  (HOSTED)
#   2. else             ->  the agent's own DATABASE_URL                    (LOCAL / poc)
#   3. DB unreachable   ->  callers degrade: empty recall + MemorySaver     (OFFLINE)
#
# DRIVER SPLIT (the fix): lg-solution's own store has two edges with different
# driver needs, so this seam routes them differently:
#
#   - memory + KB (pgvector)  ->  KDCube's `pg_pool` DIRECTLY. That pool is an
#     *asyncpg* pool (the SAME object `conv_index` uses), and asyncpg IS installed
#     in the proc. `resolve_solution_memory` hands the memory/KB constructors the
#     pool + the tenant/project schema; they acquire from it, qualify their tables
#     with that schema, and scope every row by columns. No psycopg — this was the
#     "No module named 'psycopg'" runtime degradation.
#   - checkpointer + optional `langgraph_store`  ->  a psycopg/libpq DSN. LangGraph's
#     `AsyncPostgresSaver`/`AsyncPostgresStore` genuinely require psycopg v3 (asyncpg
#     can't drive them), so for THOSE we derive a DSN from the SAME platform settings
#     `get_pg_pool()` builds the pool from (`get_settings()` PG* fields), carrying the
#     tenant/project schema on its libpq search_path. psycopg[binary] is added to the
#     proc requirements for this path; absent it, the checkpointer degrades to
#     MemorySaver.
#
# The pool's PRESENCE is the hosted signal; the settings are the durable bridge for
# the psycopg DSN. We never hand the asyncpg pool across the psycopg boundary.
