"""The fork projection: what a child conversation opens with.

A fork is a projection copy, not a shared timeline: the parent's CURRENT-TURN
blocks (what the parent is amid) plus the parent conversation's WORKING
SUMMARIES (the compaction machinery's durable per-turn digests, including the
range summary when the parent has compacted) become the child conversation's
pre-existing history. Copied blocks keep their text, authorship, turn ids and
timestamps; the one mechanical rewrite is conversation-qualifying their refs.
Refs minted after qualification-at-birth already carry their home
``conv_<parent id>.`` scope segment (the rewrite is idempotent); the rewrite
pins any legacy conversation-local ref persisted before that, so every ref in
the copy names the parent conversation and resolves from the child.
