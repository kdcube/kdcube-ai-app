"""Reusable ReAct tools for the SDK canvas solution.

Bundles normally connect this module through
``surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>.tools`` with alias ``canvas``. The
exported tool id is:

```text
canvas.patch
```

Canvas board reads are not exposed as an agent tool. They are exposed as
external `cnv:` refs that can be imported into the ReAct workspace with
`react.pull(paths=["cnv:<name>"])` for the current board. Use
`cnv:<name>@<revision>` only when exact JSON for a known revision is needed.

The tools bind to the current bundle runtime at call time. Bundle-specific
transport and storage names are supplied through `bundle_props.canvas`; the
tool implementation itself remains part of the SDK canvas solution.
