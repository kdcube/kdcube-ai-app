"""Reusable ReAct tools for the SDK canvas solution.

Bundles normally include this module in `tools_descriptor.py` with alias
`canvas` and `use_sk: true`. The exported tool ids are:

```text
canvas.read
canvas.patch
```

The tools bind to the current bundle runtime at call time. Bundle-specific
transport and storage names are supplied through `bundle_props.canvas`; the
tool implementation itself remains part of the SDK canvas solution.
