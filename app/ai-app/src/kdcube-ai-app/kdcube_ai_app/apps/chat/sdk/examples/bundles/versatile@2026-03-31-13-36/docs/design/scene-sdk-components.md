# Versatile Scene SDK Components

The active main view is `ui/scene`. It is a host scene for reusable SDK
components, not a second custom chat implementation.

```text
ui/scene
  |
  +-- iframe: widgets/versatile_chat
  |     source: sdk://solutions/chat/ui/widget
  |
  +-- iframe: widgets/memories
  |     source: sdk://context/memory/ui/widget/memories
  |
  +-- React component: CanvasBoard
        source: sdk://solutions/canvas/ui/component
```

## Backend Surfaces

The scene uses bundle operations for request/response APIs:

| Operation | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `canvas_list` | List the current user's canvases for the scene story. |
| `canvas_read` | Read one canvas projection. |
| `canvas_attachment_upload` | Host local dropped files as canvas-owned attachments. |
| `canvas_object_action` | Call the resolver for a pinned object's namespace. |

Canvas mutations are published over Data Bus:

| Subject | Partition | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canvas.patch` | `object_ref` | Ordered canvas revision writes. |

Use generic canvas names. Do not prefix them with this bundle id. The scene is
demonstrating a reusable SDK component, so the protocol names are `canvas.*`.

## Chat Context Wiring

The scene tells the chat widget which event-source ids to use:

| Query Param | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `chat_canvas_state_event_source_id` | `canvas.state` |
| `chat_canvas_focus_event_source_id` | `canvas.focus` |
| `chat_canvas_surface` | `canvas` |
| `chat_canvas_ingress_message` | `kdcube-canvas-ingress` |
| `chat_canvas_patch_step` | `canvas.patch` |

When the user attaches the whole board, the scene sends
`kdcube-context-attach` to the chat widget. When the user attaches cards, the
scene sends `kdcube-context-focus`.

Dragging a card from canvas to chat always passes the proxied object context
(`task:`, `mem:`, `fi:`, `cnv:`, etc.). If the user also attaches the whole
canvas, the timeline receives both the canvas state event and the focused
object events.

## Memory Widget Wiring

The memory widget remains the owner of memory UI behavior. The scene only
mounts the iframe and forwards context messages from the memory widget to chat.

```text
memory widget drag
  -> kdcube-context-focus / kdcube-context-attach
  -> scene broker
  -> versatile_chat iframe
```

The compact view is the default. The scene can enlarge it through
`kdcube-set-view` with `widget=memories`.

## Canvas Object Resolvers

The backend registers resolvers for namespaces the scene can display:

| Namespace | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `fi:` | ReAct event/artifact resolver |
| `mem:` | memory subsystem resolver |
| `cnv:` | canvas-owned object resolver |
| configured namespaces, for example `task:` | named-service provider resolver |

The canvas card stores one canonical object ref. The resolver owns preview,
download, open, and rehost behavior.

Configured named-service resolvers are read from bundle props:

```yaml
named_services:
  namespaces:
    task:
      clients:
        default_client:
          tools:
            allowed_operations: [provider.about, object.list, object.search, object.get, object.schema, object.upsert, object.delete]
        canvas:
          resolver:
            enabled: true
```

The SDK helper `register_configured_named_service_canvas_resolvers(...)`
registers `named_services.namespaces` into the canvas object resolver registry.
The same registry backs the scene canvas and the chat widget object-action path
through `canvas_object_action`.

The `default_client.tools.allowed_operations` list controls model-callable
tools. The `canvas.resolver.enabled` switch only enables generic canvas/chat
resolution for that namespace. Canvas still sends generic actions such as
`open`, `preview`, `describe`, and `capabilities` through the resolver; the
owning provider decides whether each action is valid.

For the task-tracker provider, `object.action(open)` returns
`target_surface = "task_tracker.issue_editor"`. The versatile scene maps that
surface to the `task_tracker_tasks` iframe from `task-tracker@1-0`, switches it
to expanded form, and posts an `open` command with the issue id/ref. The same
widget can be opened as `task_tracker.issue_list` in compact form from the
scene rail.
