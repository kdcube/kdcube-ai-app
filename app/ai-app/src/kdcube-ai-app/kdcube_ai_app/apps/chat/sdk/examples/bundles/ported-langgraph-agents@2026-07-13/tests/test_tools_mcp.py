"""The "tools, both ways" seam (platform/tools_mcp.py) — thin over the SDK.

The mechanism moved to SDK: `solutions/connections/delegated_mcp` resolves the
per-user MCP server map (minting a delegated bearer for delegated connections)
and `frameworks/langchain/mcp` binds it as LangChain tools. This bundle module
is the thin adapter (connection list + turn user -> LangChain tools). Asserts:
only `kind: mcp` connections are considered, and clean degradation (no MCP
connections / adapter absent -> [] , the agent still builds with plain tools).
Fully offline.
