# KDCube Services App

`kdcube-services@1-0` is the built-in app for KDCube-owned service surfaces that
external clients may access through Connection Hub delegated credentials.

It is intentionally neutral: it is not an "admin bundle" as a whole. Some tools
are admin-only because their descriptor grants are delegable only by admins.
Other future tools can be regular user services.

## Current Service

### Conversations

MCP endpoint:

```text
/api/integrations/bundles/{tenant}/{project}/kdcube-services@1-0/public/mcp/conversations
```

Tool:

| Tool | Grant | Default delegability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conversations_export` | `conversations:read` | `kdcube:role:super-admin` |

This is the platform-native replacement for the old root `/mcp`
conversation-export shortcut used by the Yay/Claude experiment. The OAuth
protocol and consent screen remain Connection Hub responsibilities; this bundle
only owns the protected product surface.

## Shape

```text
kdcube-services@1-0/
  entrypoint.py                  # thin surface adapter
  surfaces/
    mcp/
      conversations.py           # FastMCP tool registration
  services/
    conversations/
      export.py                  # conversation export product logic
  config/
    bundles.template.yaml
    bundles.secrets.template.yaml
  interface/
    README.md
  docs/
    README.md
    journal/
```

## Auth Model

The `@mcp(..., auth_config="surfaces.as_provider.mcp.conversations.auth")`
decorator points the platform to the descriptor path for the auth policy.
The actual policy is descriptor-owned:

```yaml
surfaces:
  as_provider:
    mcp:
      conversations:
        auth:
          mode: managed
          authority_id: delegated_client
          tools:
            conversations_export:
              grants: [conversations:read]
          selected_tool_grants: true
```

When a client calls the MCP endpoint:

```text
Bearer token
  -> proc managed MCP guard
  -> Connection Hub delegated credential grant record
  -> authority_id + resource + selected tool + required grants
  -> FastMCP tool dispatch
```

The tool does not check roles itself. By the time it runs, the surface guard has
validated the delegated credential and selected tool grant.

The FastMCP surface uses stateless streamable HTTP because the proc bridge
dispatches each bundle MCP request independently.

## Extension Rule

Add future KDCube service families as separate modules and separate MCP aliases.
For example:

```text
services/
  conversations/
  usage/
  users/
```

Each family gets its own `surfaces.as_provider.mcp.<alias>.auth` policy and
Connection Hub resource entry, so consent remains concrete and tool-centric.
