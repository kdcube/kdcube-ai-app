"""The consent breakdown ANY KDCube-served MCP surface returns on a per-agent
grant miss.

A surface guarded by the delegated-client boundary denies an operation whose
grants the caller's bearer lacks. The denial is a CONTRACT, uniform across
surfaces: it names the exact missing grants, and for a hosted-agent caller
(`kdcube-agent:<app>:<agent>`) it carries the full consent block — agent
identity, the granted resource, the claims, and the one-click
`delegated_agent_grant_create` action — so the caller's chat surface raises
the scoped demand without knowing anything about the specific service. The
agent identity and resource come from the REQUEST's own bound credential
(the grant record's client id, or the delegate subject; the credential's
granted resource), so every surface answers identically with one call.

External OAuth clients (Claude Code) keep the reconnect / incremental-consent
guidance instead — their consent loop is the OAuth journey, not a chat banner.
