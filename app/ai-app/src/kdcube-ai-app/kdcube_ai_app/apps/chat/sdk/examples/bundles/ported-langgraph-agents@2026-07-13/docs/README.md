# Ported LangGraph Agents Design

`ported-langgraph-agents@2026-07-13` is the **"one app, many agents"** worked
instance of the KDCube port recipe. It hosts **two** standalone LangGraph agents,
vendored **unchanged**, behind a **single `execute_core`** that dispatches on
**`agent_id`**:

- `lg-solution` — the rich research graph (KB retrieval + per-user pgvector memory
  + a nested subagent). Linear shape with a **dedicated answer node**.
- `lg-react` — a `langchain.agents.create_agent` ReAct agent (plain tools + MCP + a
  code-exec tool; `SummarizationMiddleware` for context). A ReAct loop with a
  looping **`model` node** and no dedicated answer node.

The teaching point is the seam that DIFFERS between the two: **different agent
shapes → different stream adapters, selected by `agent_id`.** Everything else is
shared platform glue.

## Owners

```text
this app owns
  - the dispatcher                 (execute_core resolves agent_id -> the right graph)
  - the per-turn graph rebuild     (each agent's graph rebuilt every turn; no cache)
  - the two stream adapters        (dedicated-answer-node + looping-model-node)
  - the multi-tenant + multi-agent identity gate
  - the storage edge               (ONE shared schema + agent_id column on pg_pool)
  - the two scene chat widgets + scene_object_action (file download)

this app consumes (does not own)
  - the KDCube chat surface        (the reactive event that starts a turn)
  - the platform conversation record (framework-neutral turn log; the app writes none)
  - comm_ctx streaming primitives  (step / delta / complete)
  - the reusable chat component + the reusable Telegram SDK

this app does NOT own
  - the chat UI, the KDCube conversation store, any KDCube-managed durable state,
    Telegram protocol mechanics
```

## The dispatcher (the core move)

```text
1. resolve     entrypoint.py     agent_id = normalize(state.agent_id) or default;
                                 spec = AGENTS[agent_id]  (unknown -> default)
2. graph       entrypoint.py     _build_graph(agent_id, disabled_tools): REBUILT this
                                 turn (no cache); reuses only the opened checkpointer
3. inputs      spec.build_inputs the agent's own input shape + run_config(thread_id)
4. stream      spec.stream       the agent's OWN adapter -> comm_ctx.step/delta/complete
5. model pick  capabilities.py   resolve_turn_role_models(self, state, agent_id) for
                                 the ACTIVE agent, bound onto role_models for the turn
```

The `AGENTS` registry is a dict of `AgentSpec(agent_id, role, build_graph, stream,
build_inputs)`. Adding an agent is adding a spec — `execute_core` never branches on
agent_id.

## The two stream adapters (the shape difference)

- `platform/stream_solution.py` — lg-solution has a **dedicated answer node**, so
  the adapter streams that node's model tokens as the answer and surfaces the other
  nodes (retrieve/plan/delegate) as steps.
- `platform/stream_prebuilt.py` — lg-react's **`model` node LOOPS** (once per
  tool-decision cycle) with no answer node, so the adapter streams ONLY the final
  model turn (visible content + no tool-call chunk) and surfaces each `tools` run
  as a step.

A different framework or agent shape swaps ONLY its adapter file; the dispatcher,
identity, and storage edge are unchanged.

## Statelessness

Each agent's graph is **rebuilt every turn** (`_build_graph`) — no in-process cache,
because KDCube is distributed and a turn lands on any worker; only the checkpointer
CONNECTION is opened once per agent and reused. Per-turn state lives only in shared
Postgres keyed by `thread_id`. Nothing per-turn lives on `self`. So any processor
worker can serve any turn for either agent (regression-tested:
`tests/test_storage_pg_target.py`, `tests/test_dispatch.py`).

## The persistence split (per agent)

Each agent keeps its **own** store — routed onto KDCube's shared Postgres into ONE
per-tenant/project schema (`kdcube_{tenant}_{project}`) with bundle-prefixed tables
(`ported_langgraph_agents_memories`/`_kb`), the two agents separated by the
**`agent_id` column** (a per-agent schema would pollute Postgres); its own
`DATABASE_URL` when standalone, an in-memory saver when unreachable. KDCube
separately owns the **conversation record** (framework-neutral turn log + a comm
events artifact replayed on reload, the same for either agent). Full ownership matrix
+ the injection point: [storage/README.md](storage/README.md).

## Dependency direction

```text
entrypoint.py ─imports→ solution/lg_solution/, solution/lg_prebuilt/, platform/
solution/*    ─imports→ nothing in KDCube   (never depends back on the platform)
platform/*    ─ depend only on comm_ctx / platform state / SDK adapters
```

Neither vendored package imports KDCube. Only the platform glue and `entrypoint.py`
know both worlds, and they import `solution/` package-relative.

## Model selection (Capabilities widget), per agent

Each agent declares the generic `simple_model_pick` provider under
`surfaces.as_consumer.agents.<agent>`, naming its own answer role and model list.
The platform serves the `agent_capabilities` / `agent_selection_update` ops
(inherited from `BaseEntrypoint`). How a pick is APPLIED is the one
framework-specific piece: `entrypoint.py` (via `platform/capabilities.py`) resolves
the saved pick for the **active** agent and binds it onto
`bundle_call_context.role_models` around that agent's graph run, so the router
overlays it on `get_client("<agent>.answer")` for that turn only. A pick for one
agent never cross-applies to the other. The selection record is platform-owned
(`UserAgentSelectionStore`, keyed per user/bundle/agent/conversation); the app only
reads through it.

## Dependencies

The union of both agents' dependency sets is pinned in
[../requirements.txt](../requirements.txt) (langgraph, langgraph-checkpoint-postgres,
langchain-core, langchain-openai, optional langchain-anthropic, psycopg v3,
pgvector, pydantic). Most already ship with the chat processor; the deltas a full
deploy adds are the Postgres checkpointer and psycopg v3 — supply them either on
the processor requirements or via the `@venv` contract. Neither agent hard-requires
more than langgraph to run: both degrade cleanly without the extras (in-memory
saver) and without a provider key (offline stub).
