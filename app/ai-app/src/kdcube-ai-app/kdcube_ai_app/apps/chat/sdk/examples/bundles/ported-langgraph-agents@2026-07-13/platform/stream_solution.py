# The standalone CLI already consumed the graph through
# `graph.astream_events(..., version="v2")` (see poc/lg-solution/lg_solution/
# cli.py): answer-node token events became printed text, node starts became
# stderr step lines. The platform layer keeps that exact loop but redirects it at KDCube's
# comm primitives instead of stdout, so the existing chat component renders the
# turn live with zero UI work.
#
# The translation is 1:1:
#   on_chain_start   (a graph node)          -> comm_ctx.step(node, "running")
#   on_chain_end     (a graph node)          -> comm_ctx.step(node, "completed")
#   on_chat_model_stream (in the answer node) -> comm_ctx.delta(token, marker="answer")
#   final answer                              -> return value + comm_ctx.complete
#
# Nothing about the graph changes. This module is framework-shaped
# (astream_events is LangChain/LangGraph); a different framework's port swaps
# this file for its own event loop and keeps everything else.
