"""A subagent implemented as a nested StateGraph.

The main graph delegates a scoped sub-question here. This subagent runs its own
retrieve -> synthesize steps against the shared knowledge base and returns a
compact finding. It is a genuine nested graph, not a helper function — so the
"subagents" story is real and each layer keeps its own state.
