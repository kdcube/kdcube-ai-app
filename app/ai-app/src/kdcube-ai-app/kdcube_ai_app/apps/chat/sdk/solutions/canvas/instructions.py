[CANVAS MODULE CONTEXT]
When a bundle attaches this canvas module, live canvas state can be rendered
for ReAct in ANNOUNCE. Treat that ANNOUNCE content as non-cached, current
working context for the turn.

The canvas renderer contributes one model-facing board section when the canvas
object itself is attached, and can add one optional selection/focus section
when selected cards are part of the request:

1. `[CANVAS BOARD]`
   This is the current live board state. It includes the canvas name/id/uri,
   revision, a spatial map, and a legend. Use the spatial map and legend for
   board awareness: what objects are present, how they are arranged, what is
   selected, and which refs are available. Map labels such as `U1`, `A1`,
   `T1`, `M1`, `S1`, `F1`, or `R1` are spatial labels; use the legend's
   `card_id` when patching an existing card. Do not edit or save the raw
   canvas JSON directly.

2. `[CANVAS FOCUSED CONTEXT]`
   This is optional canvas selection context for the same board/revision. It is
   emitted when the user has selected or multi-selected cards on the canvas and
   asks about that selection, for example "analyze selected cards" or other
   batch operations over the board selection. It carries selected card ids/refs
   plus canvas provenance. Treat it as a turn-local selection over canvas
   cards, not as a new object identity.

Cards dragged from canvas into chat are not rendered as a special canvas-focus
section. They are rendered as the objects they proxy: `mem:` as memory context,
`task:` as task/issue context, `fi:` as a platform artifact, canvas-owned
`ext:` refs as canvas-owned user/assistant content, and so on. Canvas
provenance may appear as metadata such as `canvas_context`, but the canonical
object ref remains the identity.

Canvas read/write behavior:
- Use the map/legend for awareness. Use `react.read(paths=["cnv:<name>@<revision>"])`
  only when exact hidden board state, full JSON, full card metadata,
  coordinates, or refs are needed.
- `react.read(paths=["cnv:<name>@<revision>"])` returns exact JSON plus an
  `agent_view`; it is not an edit. A read can refresh canvas ANNOUNCE.
- Collaborate only through `canvas.patch` with `base_revision` set to the
  visible canvas revision. Do not edit/re-save canvas JSON directly.
- Each successful `canvas.patch` creates a new canvas revision and a
  `event.canvas` tool/result event.
- The canvas view in ANNOUNCE is expected to stay visible until the current
  turn ends. In a later turn, re-read or wait for a fresh canvas event if the
  board is relevant.

Card placement and ref behavior:
- Map labels are for spatial reasoning. For patching existing cards, use
  `card_id` values from the legend or from `react.read(paths=["cnv:<name>@<revision>"])`.
- `placement=placed` means the card is visible on the board map with a rect.
  `placement=floating` means the card exists in the canvas revision but is not
  part of the placed spatial map yet. `placement=suggested` is a pending
  assistant/user suggestion waiting for user acceptance or arrangement.
  `placement=trashed` means it is in the persisted bin.
- `ext:` and `fi:` refs are pull/readable when the visible preview is missing
  or insufficient. `mem:`, `so:`, and `task:` refs use their subsystem tools or
  resolvers.
- Canvas-owned cards are hosted by the bundle, not by the platform
  conversation artifact store:
  - `user.text` is user-authored text created on the canvas and remains an
    `ext:` ref when attached into chat.
  - `user.attachment` is a user upload created on the canvas and remains an
    `ext:` ref when attached into chat.
  - `agent.text` is assistant-authored text created on the canvas through
    `canvas.patch` or dragged from an assistant response; it is also an `ext:`
    ref.
- Chat-authored data is different: user chat text and assistant chat replies
  are conversation replicas, and chat-uploaded files are platform conversation
  attachments/artifacts. Do not rename canvas-owned `ext:` objects as chat
  prompt or chat attachment data.
- Host applications may define additional card kinds and resolver namespaces.
  Canvas can annotate proxy cards with descriptions/comments, but editing the
  underlying object belongs to the owning subsystem's tools/APIs.
- `user.text` card content may be updated with `update_card content={text}`.
- Proxy card refs such as `mem:`, `fi:`, `task:`, search/source refs, and
  hosted attachments stay immutable. You may update the canvas-owned
  description and comments on those cards when the user asks.
- New assistant output should usually be a suggested card, not an automatic
  placed card, so the user can arrange, accept, or discard it.
- Producing a file/report/output does not pin it. First produce the artifact,
  then call `canvas.patch` with a `new_card` whose `logical_path` points at the
  produced `fi:` or `ext:` ref.

Semantics:
- Canvas is an editable collaborative board. Stories, tickets, memories, files,
  attachments, search results, and ReAct artifacts are cards/refs on the board;
  they are not the board identity.
- Snapshot context is read-only informative state. It is not editable canvas
  state and should not be patched through canvas tools.
- Attaching a pin to chat is turn-local user intent about the proxied object.
  It does not create, delete, or move canvas cards by itself.
- Positioning existing cards is the user's/UI's responsibility. Do not move,
  resize, or arrange existing cards.
