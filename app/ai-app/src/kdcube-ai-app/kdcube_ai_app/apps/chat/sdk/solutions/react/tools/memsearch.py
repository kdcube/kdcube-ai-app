        "Conversations are one of the user's memory realms - what was actually said in chat - "
        "alongside durable memories (`mem`) and context boards (`cnv`); together they are districts "
        "of the user's memory. Searches what the USER said (prompts and follow-ups), what the ASSISTANT "
        "said (replies and working summaries), and the user's UPLOADED attachments (their indexed "
        "summaries): pick `targets` by what the user is recalling ('I said...' -> user/attachment; "
        "'you said...' -> assistant). Reach for it whenever a look back would likely help: on an explicit "
        "recall request, AND when the user's intent implies earlier context matters - they refer to "
        "something from before, say it was clearer earlier, can't find or re-locate something, or resume "
        "a dropped thread. "
        "Search prior conversation memory and return turn-level recovery handles. "
        "Use only when the exact needed path is not already visible. "

        "broad conversation overview -> no `query`, no `ordinal`, no bounds, with `targets=['summary']`. "

        "(\"last week we talked about ...\", \"yesterday you helped me with ...\", a topic "
        "the user clearly worked on before but not in this conversation), pass `scope=\"user\"`. "

        "read conv:ar:turn_<id>.react.turn.index, then batch-read/pull exact conv:ar:/conv:tc:/conv:fi:/conv:so: refs. "
