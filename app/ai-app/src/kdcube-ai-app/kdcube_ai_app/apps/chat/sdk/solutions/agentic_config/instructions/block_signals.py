"""The curated meaning of every built-in block: SIGNALS and semantic tags.

Each block carries runtime signals — the behaviors it protects or teaches.
This map states them in the signal-table language
(``docs/sdk/agents/react/system-instruction-README.md`` is the authoritative
long form) so the constructor can show WHAT a block means and offer tags that
reflect meaning, not mechanics. Custom blocks author their own signals and
keywords at save time; this map covers the in-tree registries.
