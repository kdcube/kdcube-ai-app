"""Materialize `fi:` file artifacts referenced by conversation turns.

Turns reference file artifacts (uploaded attachments, produced outputs, snapshots,
and pulled external attachments) as `fi:` logical paths — both as search-result
handles and inside turn text (e.g. working summaries). External clients reach them
through the `conv` namespace as `conv:fi:<path>` object refs.

This module owns the byte materialization: it reuses the proven react workspace
hydration (`rehost_files_from_timeline`) to pull one artifact into a temp dir and
read its bytes, then the caller shapes it into a JSON object (text inline / bounded
base64) or a streamed result. The hydration is user-scoped through the browser's
runtime_ctx, so a caller only materializes their own conversations' files.
