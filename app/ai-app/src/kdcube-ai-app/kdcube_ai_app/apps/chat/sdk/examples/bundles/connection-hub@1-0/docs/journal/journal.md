## Baseline carried forward

Connection Hub started as the user-scoped third-party account connection hub:

- provider -> connector app -> user account;
- one shared `connection_oauth_callback` for OAuth providers;
- user-scoped tokens in `ConnectionStore`;
- Gmail and Slack through the `connections` framework;
- iCloud through app-password email settings;
- named-service discovery registration on app load.

The current dated journal entry adds the missing identity layer and makes clear
that role resolution belongs to a platform principal/role resolver, not to the
Connection Hub app itself.
