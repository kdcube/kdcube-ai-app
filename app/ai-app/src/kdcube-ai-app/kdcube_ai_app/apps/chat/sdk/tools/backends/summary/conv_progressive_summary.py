Do NOT continue the conversation. Do NOT respond to any questions in the conversation. ONLY output the structured summary."""

SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """The messages above are a conversation to summarize. Create a structured context checkpoint summary that another LLM will use to continue the work.

Use this EXACT format:

## Active Work Reminder
active_request:
- [One or two bullets that make the active request recognizable after compaction]
retrieval_anchors:
- phrase: "[exact user wording, error text, log phrase, or unique title]"
- entity: "[tool id, function/class name, bundle id, task id, turn id, or subsystem]"
- time: "[timestamp or time range if known]"
read_refs:
- [KDCube logical path only: conv:ar:/conv:tc:/conv:fi:/conv:ws:/conv:su:/conv:so:, or "(none yet)"]
done:
- [What has already been completed toward this active request]
open:
- [What remains unresolved or needs verification]
next:
- [The immediate next action the continuing model should take]
recovery_plan:
- first: "Use this visible reminder and the retained suffix before searching."
- if_needed: "Use react.memsearch with the exact phrase/entity anchors above."
- then_read: "Use react.read(paths=[...read_refs]). For large text, first use stats_only, then ranged react.read items to recover the needed lines by parts."

## Goals
[What is the user trying to accomplish? Can be multiple items if the session covers different tasks.]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Any constraints, preferences, or requirements mentioned by user]
- [Or "(none)" if none were mentioned]

## Progress
### Done
- ✓ [Completed tasks/changes]

### In Progress
- … [Current work]

### Not Started
- □ [Planned but not started]

### Blocked
- [Issues preventing progress, if any]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Brief rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [Ordered list of what should happen next]

## Critical Context
- [Any data, examples, or references needed to continue]
- [Or "(none)" if not applicable]

If you see protocol violations, repeated tool errors, or missing files, summarize them under **Blocked** or **Critical Context** so the next agent avoids the same mistake.
Internal notes may appear as `react.note` blocks and are tagged:
- [P] personal/preferences
- [D] decisions/rationale
- [S] specs/structure/technical details
- [A] achievements, completed milestones, or project-level accomplishment notes
- [K] key artifacts/anchors with logical path and why they matter
Treat these as high-signal. Preserve them in the appropriate sections:
- [P] -> Constraints & Preferences
- [D] -> Key Decisions
- [S] -> Critical Context
- [A] -> Progress (usually Done; if still relevant, also Next Steps or Critical Context)
- [K] -> Critical Context (preserve the path and the one-line explanation)
Live turn events may appear as `user.followup` or `user.steer` blocks:
- `user.followup` = additional user input for the same running turn
- `user.steer` = user redirection/stop signal for the same running turn
Treat both as high-priority user intent updates. Preserve them in Goals, Constraints & Preferences, Key Decisions, Next Steps, or Critical Context wherever they materially changed what the agent should do next.

If exact tool-result or artifact content is large enough that it will not remain
visible after compaction, do not say the exact data is still "loaded", "in
memory", or "available" without naming the recovery path. Preserve the logical
path and state that model-visible recovery should use `react.read`, `stats_only`,
and bounded ranged `react.read` items. Exec output is capped too; mention exec
only for computation or for producing smaller derived artifacts.

The Active Work Reminder is the handoff and retrieval anchor for a future model
that sees only compacted memory. Make it recognizable and searchable: include
exact phrases, tool ids, task ids, turn ids, timestamps, and KDCube logical
paths where available. `read_refs` must contain only model-facing logical refs
(`conv:ar:`, `conv:tc:`, `conv:fi:`, `conv:ws:`, `conv:su:`, or `conv:so:`). Do not invent physical host file
paths as recovery handles. If a user mentioned a host/local path, preserve it
only as quoted context in `phrase` or Critical Context, not as `read_refs`.
Avoid vague references like "that log" unless the same line names exact visible
text or a logical ref. If there is truly no active work, write
`open: - (none)`, `next: - wait for new user input`, `read_refs: - (none yet)`,
and `recovery_plan: - first: "No recovery needed."`.
`active_request` is the narrow resumable task the next model should recognize
and continue. `## Goals` is the broader user/project objective set and may include
completed or parked goals. Do not duplicate the same vague sentence in both.

Keep each section concise. Preserve exact logical paths, function names, and
error messages. Preserve user-provided physical paths only as context, not as
readable recovery paths."""

## Next Steps
1. [Update based on current state]

TURN_PREFIX_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """This is the PREFIX of a turn that was too large to keep. The SUFFIX (recent work) is retained.

Summarize the prefix to provide context for the retained suffix.
Do not output a full conversation summary. Do not use `## Active Work Reminder`
or `## Goals` here; those sections belong to prior-conversation summaries.
This output is embedded under a `[MID-TURN COMPACTION]` block as

active_request:
- [Make the current turn's active request recognizable]
retrieval_anchors:
- phrase: "[exact user wording, error text, log phrase, result title, or unique phrase]"

original_request:
- [What did the user ask for in this turn?]

early_progress:
- [Key decisions and work done in the prefix]

context_for_suffix:
- [Information needed to understand the retained recent work]

compacted_large_results:
- [For each large tool result or artifact that will be compacted out of the
  rendered prefix, name the logical path and explain how to exploit it
  programmatically.]
- Include the result shape/schema: top-level keys, important nested arrays,
  item fields, counts, and status/error fields.
- Include a tiny representative sample, not the whole payload. For list-like
  data, show 1-2 sample items with field names and shortened values. For email
  batches, include an example message object shape such as sender/from, subject,
  date/internal_date, snippet/body_excerpt, message/thread ids, and any flags
  present.
- State the recommended recovery method, usually
  `react.read(paths=["<conv:tc:...result>"])`, then `stats_only` and ranged `react.read`
  items if the result is large text. Exec output is capped too; mention exec
  only for computation or for producing smaller derived artifacts.
- If there are files or sources produced by the result, mention their logical
  paths or selector shape (`conv:fi:...`, `conv:so:sources_pool[...]`) and which tool call
  produced them.
- Do not claim the future agent has the full payload visible. Explain that the
  payload is compacted in the render and must be reopened by logical path.

Internal notes may appear as `react.note` blocks and are tagged [P]/[D]/[S]/[A]/[K].
[A] means achievements, completed milestones, or project-level accomplishment notes.
[K] means key artifacts/anchors with logical path and why they matter.
Live turn events may appear as `user.followup` or `user.steer` blocks. They are real user control input for the same turn and should be preserved if they explain why the retained suffix changed direction, scope, or stopping behavior.
Preserve their substance if they are relevant, especially when they explain why the retained suffix exists, what was already completed earlier in the turn, or which artifact the future agent should reopen first.

If exact tool-result or artifact content is large enough that it will not remain
visible after compaction, do not say the exact data is still "loaded", "in
memory", or "available" without naming the recovery path. Preserve the logical
path and state that model-visible recovery should use `react.read`, `stats_only`,
and bounded ranged `react.read` items. Also preserve enough structure and a tiny
sample for the next model to choose correct ranges or write correct derived
artifact code without guessing the payload schema.
`active_request` is the narrow resumable task inside this turn prefix.
`original_request` is the full user ask that started the turn.

Be concise. Focus on what's needed to understand the kept suffix."""
