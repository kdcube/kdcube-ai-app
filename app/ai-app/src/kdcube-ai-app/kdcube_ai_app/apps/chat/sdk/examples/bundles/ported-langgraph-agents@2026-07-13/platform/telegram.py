# ── telegram.py ── the Telegram ingress seam ──
#
# A SECOND surface for the SAME research turn. Where the reactive chat turn is
# driven by a browser message, this seam is driven by a Telegram Bot API webhook.
# Both land on the SAME `execute_core` — the Telegram side only routes + renders;
# it duplicates no product (research) logic.
#
# All Telegram protocol mechanics — webhook secret verification, update parsing,
# canonical ingress submission, attachment hosting, progress streaming, Bot API
# rendering, the Telegram user registry, and final delivery — are owned by the
# reusable SDK integration:
#
#   kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.integrations.telegram
#
# This module is the thin bundle-side wiring that the SDK checklist prescribes:
#   1. bind the bundle-owned registry storage (under the bundle storage root),
#   2. delegate the webhook to `user_admin.handle_webhook(...)`,
#   3. wrap the turn run with `user_admin.run_with_queued_telegram_delivery(...)`
#      so the processor side (which sees the real turn result) delivers the answer.
#
# Nothing here knows how research works; the entrypoint keeps that in execute_core.
