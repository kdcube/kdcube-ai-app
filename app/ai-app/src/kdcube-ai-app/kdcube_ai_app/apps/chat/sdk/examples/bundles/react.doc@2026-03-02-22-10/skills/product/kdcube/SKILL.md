  Knowledge about the KDCube platform — a multi‑tenant, self‑hosted runtime + SDK
  for building AI assistants, copilots, and agentic apps. Covers bundles/workflows,
  streaming + timeline, tools/skills, isolated execution, economics/accounting,
  provenance/citations, and deployment options (local, EC2, ECS).
  Important: ensure this skill is always in front of your eyes ("read", marked
  with 💡) whenever the user is asking about KDCube tech, features, architecture,
  deployment, or SDK usage. If the task is about bundle code generation,
  modification, review, extraction, or troubleshooting, also load
  `sk:tests.bundles` so the current bundle contract and smoke-test expectations
  are in context.

# KDCube Product Knowledge

## Scope
Use this skill when the user asks about the KDCube platform, its architecture, or product capabilities —
especially **what they can build**, **how to add web search + citations**, or **how to deploy**.

Bundle-authoring rule:
- If the task is about generating, editing, extracting, repairing, reviewing, or validating bundle code,
  read `sk:tests.bundles` as well before answering or generating code.
- Keep this product skill loaded for the platform/runtime model, and keep the tests skill loaded for the
  current bundle contract and validation workflow.
- Do not write platform-integrated code from skills alone.
- For bundle code generation or modification, do not start with file writes after reading only skills.
  Before the first write, read the current tests that define the contract and the current docs/examples/source
  that define the requested SDK pattern.
- Use only platform symbols, import paths, runtime types, and helper APIs that you have confirmed from
  current docs or source. Do not invent them.
- Be economical: read the smallest relevant set of exact docs/source/example files that can confirm the requested pattern.
- If docs mention candidate code paths, treat those paths as the next files to read.
- If the exact file is still unclear, browse a small relevant subtree in exec and then read the exact discovered files.
- For SDK-integrated bundle work, current tests and current source/examples outrank skill prose.

## Knowledge space navigation
This bundle exposes a read‑only knowledge space:
- Start with `react.read(["ks:index.md"])` to see the current index.
- Use `react.search_knowledge(query=..., root="ks:docs")` to search docs.
- Use `react.read(["ks:docs/<path>"])` to open a doc.
- Use `react.read(["ks:<real-app-ai-app-relative-path>"])` when a doc or result gives you an exact path such as `ks:src/...` or `ks:deployment/...`.
These are real app-relative paths under one common `ks:` root, not special platform-mandated namespace folders.
The index is generated on bundle startup by scanning `docs/` and deployment markdown under the prepared common root.
Doc pages should mention real `app/ai-app`-relative paths such as `src/...`, `deployment/...`, `docs/...`, or `ui/...`.
The bundle prepares one common root from the repo configured in bundle props (`knowledge.repo`, `knowledge.ref`, `knowledge.root`).

Important limitations:
- `react.search_knowledge` primarily indexes docs metadata, not the whole source tree.
- Source, deployment, and test files are readable by exact `ks:<real-relative-path>` only when the correct path is known.
- If the exact `ks:` path is not obvious, do not guess repeatedly.

Advertised roots for this bundle:
- `ks:docs`
  - docs root
  - searchable via `react.search_knowledge`
  - exact-readable via `react.read`
  - browseable in exec if you resolve it
- `ks:deployment`
  - deployment files root
  - deployment markdown is searchable
  - exact file reads use `react.read`
  - browseable in exec if you resolve it
- `ks:src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk`
  - SDK source browsing start point
  - not indexed for search
  - exact-readable when the concrete path is known
  - browseable in exec if you resolve it
- `ks:src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/infra`
  - infra source browsing start point
  - not indexed for search
  - exact-readable when the concrete path is known
  - browseable in exec if you resolve it
- `ks:src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/tests`
  - reusable test fixtures
  - not indexed for search
  - exact-readable when the concrete path is known
  - browseable in exec if you resolve it

When a doc references files and the exact `ks:` path is unclear:
1. If the mapping is obvious, derive the exact logical path and `react.read` it directly.
2. If the mapping is not obvious or you need to browse descendants, use isolated exec with `execute_code_python(...)`.
3. Inside generated code, call `bundle_data.resolve_namespace(...)` on a real subtree such as `ks:src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk`, `ks:deployment`, or another exact `ks:` base relevant to the task.
4. Browse the returned exec-local `physical_path` narrowly and economically.
5. Emit exact logical refs such as `ks:src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/runtime/execution.py` or `ks:deployment/docker/local-infra-stack/docker-compose.yml` into an OUTPUT_DIR file or short `user.log` note.
6. Back in the React loop, call `react.read(...)` on those emitted logical refs before coding against them.

For implementation tasks:
- prefer current source/examples over prose when exact symbol names matter
- if a requested integration is still uncertain after docs, read one or more current example/source files before coding
- if the relevant source/example file is not yet known, use a small exec browse to discover candidate files and then read the exact discovered files
- if examples differ, start from the smallest implementation that matches the confirmed contract and extend only after validation

`bundle_data.resolve_namespace(...)` is exec-only. It is not a normal planning-time tool.

## Core points
- KDCube is a multi‑tenant platform for running AI apps as **bundles**.
- Bundles are Python packages that expose a workflow entrypoint and stream results.
- The runtime supports **live streaming**, **timeline state**, and **artifacts**.
- Tools can run in‑proc or isolated (local/docker/fargate).
- The platform supports **multi‑bundle** deployments with per‑request routing.
- Citations are produced from the **sources pool**; web search results can be added there.

## What you can build
- Customer‑facing assistants and copilots (multi‑tenant by design)
- Domain‑specific agents with custom tools/skills and isolated execution
- Streaming chat apps with live widgets and provenance
- Admin/ops dashboards and monitoring flows via bundles

## Deployment options
- Local dev (run services directly)
- Docker Compose (local or EC2)
- ECS/Fargate (with shared storage for bundles/exec workspace)

## Evidence and citations
This skill ships with sources in `sources.yaml`.
When this skill is loaded via `react.read("sk:product.kdcube")`, those sources are merged into the
`sources_pool`. Use `[[S:n]]` citations that correspond to the sources pool entries.

## When unsure
Search the knowledge space first (`react.search_knowledge` + `react.read`). If the needed
info is not in the knowledge space, or the exact `ks:` file path is still unclear after direct reads,
use exec-time namespace resolution as described above. If the needed info is still not in bundle knowledge,
use `web_tools.web_search` and cite sources.
