Scale the summary to the turn: for trivial exchanges (greeting, acknowledgment, tiny answer), one line or a few words per field. Refs should be logical paths for the user prompt, decisive tool calls/results, produced artifacts, and the assistant completion when known. Retrieval-anchors feed a lexical (BM25F-style) retrieval layer that runs ALONGSIDE semantic search: each anchor is indexed as a high-weight token, so future searches by the user's LITERAL phrasing find this turn even when the prose summary paraphrased it. Discipline: `phrases` = verbatim strings the user might re-quote (exact filenames, exact error messages, exact titles, the user's exact wording — never paraphrases); `entities` = high-IDF proper nouns (product/tool/project/person/bundle ids — would this token uniquely identify this turn among hundreds? if no, drop it; never generic nouns like \"file\"/\"data\"/\"report\"). Both keys are optional; emit empty lists or omit the block entirely for trivial turns. Concrete example for a turn that built a Q2 forecast spreadsheet and hit an openpyxl error while renaming a column: phrases: [\"Forecast-Q2-2026.xlsx\", \"openpyxl IndexError\", \"rename ARR contribution column\"]; entities: [\"Forecast-Q2-2026.xlsx\", \"openpyxl\", \"ARR contribution\"].
