# A plain LangChain `@tool` both ported agents can bind: the model writes Python,
# this tool runs it in the isolated sandbox (via platform/code_exec.py), and every
# file the code produces is hosted into KDCube's conversation storage EXACTLY like
# a user attachment. The tool returns a CONCISE TEXT result — truncated
# stdout/stderr plus REFERENCES to the created files (rn + filename + mime). The
# file BYTES are never in the message, only the refs (the same discipline the
# React agent's `host_files` keeps).
#
# The tool is inert unless it runs inside an active `code_exec_scope` (entered by
# `execute_core` around the graph run). Offline / disabled, it fails open with a
# short message and the turn still answers.

# NOTE (for later): the RUNTIME-NEUTRAL guidance below (write-to-files, network

# is currently DERIVED (`build_packages_installed_block`). The clean fix is to extract
# the neutral blocks into shared SDK builders and have BOTH the React tool and this
# wrapper compose from them, so there is one source of truth. Tracked as a future SDK
# refactor; this wrapper copies for now.

        produces.

        Use this to compute, transform data, generate files (CSV, JSON, images,
        charts, reports), or explore data. Top-level ``await`` is allowed. Network
        access is disabled.

        INPUTS
        - `code` (REQUIRED): the Python program (a module body / snippet). The code is
          passed HERE as an argument (not via a channel). Write files with PLAIN relative
          paths — e.g. ``wb.save("sample.xlsx")`` — the working directory is already the
          deliverables folder, and EVERY file your code writes is hosted and delivered
          automatically. You do NOT need to know any output directory or turn id.
          Files you pulled with ``pull_files`` are in this working directory — read
          them with their bare filenames, e.g. ``open("report.docx", "rb")``. The
          directory starts EMPTY every turn: pull first, then run.
        - `contract` (optional): a list of `{filepath, description, visibility?}` naming
          the files you PLAN to produce. It is ADVISORY — it labels your intended
          outputs in the exec panel and helps you plan; it does NOT change where you
          write or what gets hosted (all files your code produces are hosted either way).
          Do NOT retry just to adjust the contract.
        - `prog_name` (optional): short label for the exec panel.
        - `timeout_s` (optional): wall-clock timeout.

        RESULTS
        - The result is a short report: status, any error (a runtime/sandbox failure
          is a PLATFORM issue you may retry; a program error is your code to fix), the
          created files as references (filename + mime + a downloadable link), and
          truncated stdout/stderr. Large outputs MUST be written to files, not printed;
          use ``print(...)`` or ``logging.getLogger("user")`` only for short progress.
