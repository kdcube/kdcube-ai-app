/**
 * @kdcube/components-core/chat — the headless chat engine.
 *
 * `createChatEngine(config)` returns a framework-agnostic controller: it owns the
 * RTK store + transport + orchestration lifted from the widget's
 * `useChatEngine.tsx`, with the `settings` singleton replaced by the injected
 * `EngineConfig` and the `host.ts` postMessage calls replaced by the host event
 * bus. Re-exports the store/slice/reducers/transport/protocol so advanced hosts
 * and the React adapter can reach the internals.
