/**
 * Host event bus — the decoupling seam that lets ANY host (React, Angular,
 * plain JS, an iframe scene) react to server- and component-originated control
 * events without the engine knowing what the host is.
 *
 * The engine NEVER reaches for `window.parent.postMessage`, a router, or a
 * login modal directly. It emits typed events here; the host subscribes via
 * `engine.on(...)` and decides what to do. The iframe/scene widget maps these
 * to `postMessage`; a website maps them to its own handlers.
 *
 * This replaces direct host-coupled behavior in the widget. The iframe adapter
 * maps host events to the current scene contracts, including
 * `kdcube.surface.command` for cross-surface object actions.
