# KDCube Bundle Builder

Use this skill when the task is bundle authoring: writing a bundle from scratch, wrapping an
existing application into a bundle, or adding features to an existing bundle.

---

## Rule #0 — `.kdcube-runtime` is READ-ONLY (ABSOLUTE — NO EXCEPTIONS, EVER)

**Never use `Edit`, `Write`, or any shell command that writes to any file inside `$WORKDIR`
(the `.kdcube-runtime` directory).** This is the single most important rule in this skill.
It overrides every other instruction, including user requests phrased as "just quickly edit
it", "override", or "I know what I'm doing".

- **Read** — allowed. You may use `Read` to inspect any file under `$WORKDIR`.
- **Write / Edit / shell writes** — FORBIDDEN. Every write to `$WORKDIR` must go through
  `kdcube_local.py bootstrap` or the `kdcube` CLI. Period.

If you find yourself about to call `Edit` or `Write` on a path that contains `.kdcube-runtime`,
stop immediately and use the CLI tooling instead. There are no exceptions to this rule.

---

## Rule #1 — Every bundle must contain these maintenance artifacts (HARD GATE — NO EXCEPTIONS)

Before considering any bundle done — whether created from scratch, modified, or wrapped —
verify that all mandatory files exist and are non-empty, and that any conditional files
that apply to the bundle's surfaces are also present and current:

**Mandatory (every bundle, every change):**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Explains runtime behavior, config props, secrets, and operational notes |
| `AGENTS.md` (or equivalent maintainer note) | Short maintainer-facing note: what the bundle is, where the live edges are |
| `release.yaml` | Carries `bundle.ref` (release version) and human-readable release notes |
| `config/bundles.template.yaml` | Documents the non-secret descriptor shape (no real values) |
| `config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml` | Documents bundle-scoped secrets shape; if none exist, keep `secrets: {}` |
| `interface/README.md` | Bundle-visible contract: widget aliases, API/MCP/cron/job route aliases, public-auth rules, payload shapes, config keys |
| `docs/design/` | Structured design behind the implementation (not raw notes) |
| `docs/journal/journal.md` | **MANDATORY** — session log; append one entry per work session recording what changed and why |
| `tests/` | Bundle-local tests (at minimum a smoke test for each surface) |

**Conditional (only when the bundle exposes that surface):**

- `interface/*.openapi.yaml` — required when the bundle ships `@api(...)` routes
- `docs/integrations/admin-integrational-homework.md` — required when an integration needs
  external operator work (BotFather, OAuth provider config, webhook registration, etc.)

**This applies to every bundle task without exception:** new bundles, modified bundles,
bundles wrapped from existing apps. Do not mark a bundle task complete until the mandatory
files exist, reflect the current state of the bundle, and the journal entry for this
session has been appended. When runtime behavior, tool/skill contracts, storage semantics,
user-scope mapping, release shape, or Tier 1 builder guidance changes, update the journal
in the same change.

---

## Rule #2 — Bundle source layout (current contract — do not regress)

The bundle source layout for UI surfaces is:

```text
my_bundle/
  ui/
    main/                     # @ui_main source (replaces the old ui-src/ folder)
    widgets/<widget-alias>/   # @ui_widget source (replaces top-level widgets/<alias>/)
```

Rules:

- **Do not scaffold new `ui-src/` folders.** That layout is retired.
- **Do not scaffold top-level `widgets/<alias>/` source folders.** Widget source lives
  under `ui/widgets/<alias>/`.
- Runtime URLs may still contain `/widgets/<alias>` — that is the **served URL contract**,
  not the source layout. Do not let the URL shape drive where you put source files.
- Older example bundles in the repo may still have `ui-src/` or top-level `widgets/` on
  disk; treat those as legacy, not as a layout to copy when authoring new bundles.
- For the full source-folder widget build contract (`OUTDIR`, `<VI_BUILD_DEST_ABSOLUTE_PATH>`,
  Vite/npm build command), use `bundle-widget-integration-README.md` (Tier 2).

---

## Rule #3 — Sparse config overrides (no enabled-flag enumeration)

Bundle config (`bundles.template.yaml`, `bundles.yaml`, runtime overrides) is **override-first**:

- Missing config means the code default applies.
- Config and bundle props should contain **intentional overrides**, especially rare disables
  or non-default values for a specific deployment.
- **Do not** generate large config sections that enumerate `enabled: true` on every resource.
  That is noise; it does not change behavior and rots when defaults move.
- When a resource needs to be disabled in a specific deployment, that disable is an
  intentional override and belongs in config — explain it in the bundle README.

---

## Rule #4 — Access control and visibility are configurable

Current decorator/config behavior for access control and visibility:

- Bundle-wide `allowed_roles` is configurable via bundle props.
- API and widget `user_types` and `roles` are decorator args and may be overridden via
  `user_types_config` / `roles_config` in bundle props.
- Resource `enabled` state is configurable through bundle props and Admin overrides.
- **The removed `enabled_config` decorator argument must not be used.** If you find it in
  legacy code, replace it with the current `enabled.*` feature-gate config shape (see
  `how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md` and `bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md`).
- Keep `bundles.template.yaml` examples sparse — show the override shape, not every flag.

---

## Rule #5 — Secrets discipline (no secrets in descriptors, docs, Redis, or git)

- Bot tokens, webhook secrets, signing keys, OAuth client secrets, API keys, and user
  credentials live in the configured secret store (`bundles.secrets.yaml` or the runtime
  secrets provider).
- Never put real values in `bundles.template.yaml`, `bundles.secrets.template.yaml`,
  README/design docs, journal entries, Redis cache keys, or git history.
- Templates document the **shape** (key names and brief descriptions), never live values.

---

## Rule #6 — SDK-discovery gate (HARD GATE — NO HAND-ROLLING WITHOUT PROOF)

**Before writing any subsystem inside a bundle, prove that the SDK does not already
provide it.** A "subsystem" is anything that is not product-specific business logic:
persistence, queueing, scheduling, transport, identity, authentication, file
delivery, UI serving, agent loops, model dispatch, retry/timeout machinery, locking,
caching, search indices, etc. Product-specific business logic is the prompt
wording, the policy rules, the user-visible workflow shape — nothing else.

This rule replaces every per-feature "do not hand-roll X" warning. The SDK grows;
enumerating forbidden patterns rots. The discoverable inventory is the source of
truth, and you must consult it every time.

### The gate (mandatory, before any non-trivial code)

For each subsystem the bundle needs, complete all four steps and record the outcome
in the design doc / journal entry for this session **before** writing the code:

1. **Search the SDK packages** for the capability. Cast a wide net — search by
   intent, not by your preferred name. At minimum:

   ```bash
   # capability surface
   grep -rln "<keyword>" \
     src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/ \
     src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/infra/plugin/ \
     src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/infra/

   # decorators the platform exposes
   grep -n "^def [a-z_]*(" \
     src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/infra/plugin/agentic_loader.py
   ```

   Search **at least three** keyword variants (synonyms, antonyms, the verb form,
   the noun form). For "queue background work", try `queue`, `job`, `enqueue`,
   `stream`, `worker`, `scheduler`, `cron`, `due`. For "serve a page", try
   `ui_main`, `main_view`, `static`, `serve`, `BundleBinaryResponse`. One miss is
   normal; three misses is a real signal that it does not exist.

2. **Open the reference bundles** under
   `src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/` and check
   whether one of them already wires that subsystem the SDK way. The shipped
   bundles are not just samples — they are the contract. Start with `versatile`
   (transport / Mini App / widget / admin / memory), `echo.ui` (`@ui_main` + build
   pipeline + `@cron`), and `kdcube.copilot` (knowledge space, `@on_job`).

3. **Read the matching SDK module's docstring or first 100 lines** to confirm what
   it covers and how it is configured (most SDK modules expose a
   `configure_<thing>(...)` entry that wires bundle-specific glue).

4. **Record the outcome** in `docs/design/<topic>.md` (and the journal entry) as a
   short block — what you searched for, what you found, and either: (a) which SDK
   module/decorator you are going to wire, or (b) the explicit reason it does not
   apply and why a custom implementation is justified. Three lines is enough; the
   point is auditability.

### Default verdict: use the SDK

If the search surfaces anything that looks even adjacent, the default is to use it
and shape your bundle around its contract — not to write a parallel implementation
because "it's simpler" or "the SDK looks heavier than I need." The SDK piece carries
operational properties (Redis locking, multi-replica safety, cache invalidation,
signed downloads, identity propagation, telemetry hooks) that hand-rolled code
silently lacks. "Looks heavier" usually means "covers the cases your MVP will hit in
production and yours does not."

### When hand-rolling is allowed

You may write a custom subsystem only if **all** of the following hold, and the
design doc says so explicitly:

- The four-step search above turned up nothing close.
- The SDK piece exists but its contract is fundamentally wrong for this bundle
  (not just "more than I need" — actually incompatible).
- A short note in `docs/design/<topic>.md` explains the gap and what migration to
  the SDK piece would look like once it covers the case.

"MVP simplicity", "I'll swap it later", and "no time to learn the SDK" are not
acceptable justifications. If you write them in the design doc, delete the custom
code and use the SDK piece.

### Pre-completion smell check

Before marking the bundle task complete, scan your own diff for these smells and,
if you find one, return to the gate above:

- A new class whose name ends in `Store`, `Executor`, `Queue`, `Runner`,
  `Scheduler`, `Dispatcher`, `Registry` — these names almost always duplicate an
  SDK block.
- An `@api(method="GET", ...)` route whose body reads a file from `Path(__file__)`
  and returns `BundleBinaryResponse` — the bundle is bypassing the declarative UI
  build pipeline.
- A `_NoopXxx` / `_StubXxx` / `_MockXxx` class passed into `configure_<sdk>(...)` —
  you are stubbing out the SDK instead of wiring it.
- A polling `asyncio` loop with `await asyncio.sleep(...)` over a file/redis
  directory — the SDK already has `@cron`, due-scan, or stream subscribers for
  this.
- Direct `models_service.generate_answer(...)` / `chat(...)` calls outside the
  bundle's workflow graph — the SDK workflows (versatile, ReAct) carry timeline,
  delivery, error reporting, and cost telemetry that a raw call skips.
- Custom `threading.Lock` / file-based mutex / `os.replace` write‑then‑rename for
  state the SDK already owns — the SDK uses Redis or SQLite with the right
  semantics.

A smell is not a verdict; it is a prompt to re-run the discovery gate against that
specific piece and either remove it or document why the SDK block does not fit.

---

## Agent task facets

This skill is one facet of a single planning agent. The agent combines:

- **creator** — write a bundle from scratch
- **integrator** — wrap an existing app into a bundle
- **configurator** — edit descriptors (`assembly.yaml`, `bundles.yaml`, `bundles.secrets.yaml`)
- **deployer** — wire bundles into the runtime and verify they load
- **local QA** — run the shared bundle suite
- **integration QA** — reload + verify in a running runtime
- **document reader** — fetch and apply Tier 1 docs before every task

These are routing hints, not separate personas.

## Authoring rule #1 — lean on the docs (HARD GATE — NO EXCEPTIONS)

**Never write bundle code, edit a descriptor, or touch runtime config from memory.**
Decorators, import paths, descriptor fields, runtime paths, and mount semantics change
between releases — guessing them produces bundles that "load" but silently misbehave, or
worse, `bundles.yaml` entries that look right but never actually resolve inside the
container. You will not catch these by reading the code — the runtime is permissive and
the symptoms are delayed.

**This rule is absolute.** It applies every single time, including:

- "small" edits to an existing bundle
- renames, path changes, adding one decorator
- "I already read it last session" — no, re-read it; state changes between sessions
- the user says "just do it quickly" — still read the docs first, then do it quickly
- the bundle lives outside the runtime workdir / outside `host_bundles_path` — **especially then**

Do NOT skip the read step because the task "looks simple." The most common failure mode
of this plugin is exactly that: the agent skips the docs, writes a plausible-looking
`bundles.yaml` entry with the host path instead of the container path, the reload
appears to succeed, and nothing works. Reading the docs is cheaper than debugging that.

### Mandatory pre-flight (do these in order, every bundle task)

Read **Tier 1 only** by default. Pull Tier 2 on demand when Tier 1 does not answer the
specific thing you are about to do.

1. **Tier 1 — always read, every bundle task (read in this order):**
   - `how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md` — routing entry point, read **first**; tells you where everything lives
   - `how-to-test-bundle-README.md` — testing / QA expectations
   - `how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md` — **SDK/platform building-block map; read before implementing any subsystem so reusable blocks (Tasks, Email, Telegram, Delivery, web/browser/rendering/exec tools, storage, widgets, jobs, MCP, Claude Code) are used instead of hand-rolled mechanics**
   - `how-to-write-bundle-README.md` — authoring / implementation design
   - `bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md` — configuration ownership model (props, secrets, runtime config)
   - `how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md` — **REQUIRED any time the bundle
     lives outside the current `host_bundles_path`, or any time you touch `bundles.yaml`
     or `assembly.yaml`.** Only source of truth for the host-path / container-path /
     mount-root split.
   - versatile reference bundle — read end-to-end (structure + `entrypoint.py`)
   - **KDCube CLI** — `kdcube_cli/README.md` (quickstart + command table) and
     `kdcube_cli/additional_README.md` (`kdcube bundle` reference); read before any
     CLI operation or descriptor mutation. Check the `kdcube-cli` skill cache first
     (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/cache/cli-docs.md`) — fetch only if cache is stale or missing.
2. **Tier 2 — only when Tier 1 is not enough.** See the Tier 2 section below for the
   trigger list. Do not preload Tier 2 "just in case" — it is large and mostly irrelevant
   to any single task.
3. Only then start writing or editing code.

If a doc contradicts this skill, the doc wins — surface the conflict to the user.

**Reading the docs is necessary but not sufficient.** Before writing any non-trivial
subsystem (persistence, queueing, scheduling, transport, identity, UI serving, agent
loops, …) you must also run the **SDK-discovery gate** — see Rule #6 below. The
docs tell you what blocks exist in principle; the gate forces you to confirm what
exists *right now* in the repo for the specific subsystem you are about to
implement, and to record that evidence in the design doc. Skipping it is the most
common way agents ship bundles that re-implement SDK functionality by accident.

### Bundle lives outside the runtime mount — read this section of the how-to twice

When the user's bundle directory is NOT under the current `host_bundles_path` from
`assembly.yaml`, the runtime cannot see it. The fix documented in
`how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md` (section "If you want to change the host
bundles root") is: edit `assembly.yaml -> paths.host_bundles_path` to the parent that
contains the bundle, then rebuild with `kdcube --workdir $WORKDIR --build --upstream`
so the new mount takes effect. After that, in `bundles.yaml` use the **container path**
= `/bundles/<relative-path-from-host_bundles_path>`.

The plugin's `bootstrap <bundle-id> <bundle-dir> --host-bundles-path <parent>` helper
does the same thing (it writes `host_bundles_path` into `assembly.yaml`), so you can
use it as a shortcut when you also want a fresh descriptor set — but it is the same
underlying action, not an alternative fix.

Do not put the host path directly into `bundles.yaml` — the runtime path and host path
are different namespaces. Read the "Host path and runtime path are not the same thing"
and "If you want to change the host bundles root" sections of the how-to before
editing anything.

## What one bundle can contain

One KDCube bundle can combine:

- Python backend entrypoint
- authenticated APIs via `@api(route="operations")`
- public APIs via `@api(route="public", public_auth=...)`
- widgets via `@ui_widget(...)`
- a full custom main UI via `@ui_main`
- storage
- deploy-scoped props and secrets
- user-scoped props and secrets
- scheduled jobs via `@cron(...)`
- dependency-isolated helpers via `@venv(...)`
- React v2 and/or Claude Code and/or custom agents
- optional Node or TypeScript backend logic behind a Python bridge

## Read order

**The plugin ships without docs — they are NOT on disk.** Resolve the
`repo:kdcube-ai-app/<path>` references below. Do not try to `Read` these paths locally,
do not try to `ls` a docs directory, do not ask the user to point you at one. The only
exception is the opt-in local fast path at the bottom of this section, which requires
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_KDCUBE_REPO_ROOT` to already be set.

### Tier 1 — always read (operational canon)

Resolve each reference **in this order** (navigate first, then the rest):

- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/bundle/build/how-to-navigate-kdcube-docs-README.md` — routing entry point; read first
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/bundle/build/how-to-test-bundle-README.md` — testing / QA expectations
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/bundle/build/how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md` — SDK/platform building-block map (Tasks, Email, Telegram, Delivery, web/browser/rendering/exec tools, storage, widgets, jobs, MCP, Claude Code); routes to integration docs before any custom implementation
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/bundle/build/how-to-write-bundle-README.md` — authoring / implementation design
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/configuration/bundle-runtime-configuration-and-secrets-README.md` — configuration ownership model (props, secrets, runtime config)
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/bundle/build/how-to-configure-and-run-bundle-README.md` — configuration + runtime (`assembly.yaml`, `bundles.yaml`, `bundles.secrets.yaml`, props/secrets, reload)
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/bundle/build/how-to-release-bundle-content-README.md` — optional Tier 1 lifecycle procedure: align bundle docs/config templates/release.yaml, validate, commit/tag/push, update descriptor ref
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_cli/README.md` — KDCube CLI quickstart & full command table
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_cli/additional_README.md` — `kdcube bundle` reference (source, identity, config/secrets patch, delete)
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/bundle/bundle-agent-integration-README.md` — **fetch when the task involves React agents with local tools, file-producing tools, MCP endpoints or client config, or Claude Code subprocess agents;** covers agent runtime comparison (React vs Claude Code), tool descriptors, skill descriptors, `@mcp(...)` endpoints, `ClaudeCodeAgentConfig`, SDK-managed skill materialization

### SDK integrations — Telegram, Email, ngrok, callbacks

Before writing any custom transport, webhook, Mini App auth, OAuth callback, or local
public-HTTPS workaround, route through the SDK building-block map
(`how-to-assemble-bundle-with-sdk-building-blocks-README.md`). For the recurring
"Telegram / webhook / Mini App / ngrok" task family, fetch the canonical docs
**from the assemble map** rather than inventing the flow:

- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/integrations/telegram/telegram-README.md` — Telegram SDK surface (webhook validation, Bot API rendering, progress streaming, Mini App `initData`, user registry, signed downloads)
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/sdk/integrations/telegram/telegram-external-prereq-README.md` — BotFather, webhook URL, Mini App, bot token (work that must happen outside KDCube before the SDK can run)
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/docs/service/cicd/ngrok-README.md` — local public-HTTPS recipe through **one** ngrok origin and the local reverse proxy; for testing Cognito/Telegram/OAuth callbacks against a local stack

Guardrails (do not violate even if the user phrases the task as "just hook up a webhook"):

- Use the Telegram SDK package; do not hand-roll the webhook registry, duplicate-update suppression, Mini App `initData` verification, or send-rendering.
- For local public callbacks, use one ngrok HTTPS origin routed through the local reverse proxy. **Never expose proc as a separate public ngrok URL.**
- Keep provider URLs and webhook/callback settings descriptor-backed (`bundles.yaml` config or `assembly.yaml` where appropriate).
- Keep bot tokens, webhook secrets, signing keys, and OAuth client secrets in the configured secret store (`bundles.secrets.yaml` or the runtime secrets provider) — never in `.env`, code, or seed descriptors.

Reference bundle `versatile@2026-03-31-13-36` is the **public reference for Telegram /
Mini App / widget / attachment / external-operator-prereq integration.** Inspect it
before implementing any of these by hand. It demonstrates:

- Telegram webhook + public route wiring (no hand-rolled webhook registry)
- Telegram Mini App / webapp support (`initData` validation handled by the SDK)
- Telegram admin/user mapping patterns
- widget operations (`@ui_widget` + `@api(route="operations")` split)
- attachment handling (signed downloads, materialized files)
- converting ReAct/agent stream output into Telegram-facing messages/artifacts
- documenting external operator prerequisites (BotFather, webhook URL, Mini App
  registration, bot token) in `docs/integrations/admin-integrational-homework.md`
- the current `ui/main/` + `ui/widgets/<alias>/` source layout

For local Telegram testing you need a public HTTPS origin — use the ngrok recipe from
`docs/service/cicd/ngrok-README.md` (one ngrok origin through the local reverse proxy;
the CLI-started runtime path is the normal flow). External operator work (BotFather, bot
token, command/menu config, webhook + Mini App URL registration) is required before code
will work end-to-end.

Read end-to-end. Directories are not fetchable as a single blob; resolve these files
individually:

- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/versatile@2026-03-31-13-36/README.md`
- `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/versatile@2026-03-31-13-36/entrypoint.py`
- To discover the rest of the tree, fetch
  `repo:kdcube-ai-app/app/ai-app/src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/examples/bundles/versatile@2026-03-31-13-36`
  then fetch the individual files you need by name (e.g. `skills_descriptor.py`,
  `tools_descriptor.py`, anything under `agents/`, `skills/`, `tools/`).

### Content Release Procedure

A content release is a versioned bundle/content repository release that is independent of the
platform release. The human supplies the version and target bundles; the agent produces a
descriptor, waits for approval, then executes and journals each step.

**When this applies:** any time the human asks to release, tag, or publish a bundle repository
without touching the platform Docker image or PyPI CLI.

**Four files every bundle must have** (see Rule #1 at the top of this skill — applies always,
not only during content releases):
- `README.md` — explains current runtime behavior, config props, secrets, and operational notes
- `release.yaml` — carries `bundle.ref` set to the release version and human-readable release notes
- `config/bundles.template.yaml` — documents the non-secret descriptor shape (no real values)
- `config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml` — documents the bundle-scoped secrets shape; if none exist, keep `secrets: {}`

**Pipeline — always in this order:**

When activated, the agent creates pipeline files under:
```text
deployment/cicd/kdcube/cicd/content-release-history/<dd.mm.yyyy>/
```

Files are created in this order:
- `descriptor-<dd.mm.yyyy.hhmm>.yaml`
- `plan-<dd.mm.yyyy.hhmm>.log`
- `execute-<dd.mm.yyyy.hhmm>.yaml`

Descriptor shape:

```yaml
context: "Short human-readable context for this content release"
keywords: [content, release, bundles]
timestamp: "dd.mm.yyyy.hhmm"
version: "YYYY.M.D.hhmm"

repositories:
  - name: <repo-alias>
    repo: git@github.com:<org>/<repo>.git
    https_repo: https://github.com/<org>/<repo>
    locally: /path/to/local/checkout
    bundles_root: path/to/bundles/root
    perform: true
    commit: true
    tag: true
    push: true
    bundles:
      - id: <bundle-id>@<version>
        path: path/to/bundle/root/<bundle-id>@<version>
        perform: true
        changes:
          - "Describe release change for this bundle"
      - id: <other-bundle-id>@<version>
        path: path/to/bundle/root/<other-bundle-id>@<version>
        perform: false
        changes: []
```

Execution journal shape:

```yaml
- step: "<step name>"
  start_time: "<timestamp>"
  end_time: "<timestamp>"
  status: success   # success | error | skipped | paused
  output: "<commit hash, tag, validation result, or other useful output>"
  error: ""
```

**Approval flow:**
1. Agent writes the descriptor.
2. Agent writes the plan (lists every file that will change).
3. Human reviews the plan.
4. Human says `approve` / `go` / `go ahead` — agent does not proceed before this.
5. Agent executes step by step, writing each outcome to the execution journal.
6. On failure: agent stops, human decides whether to fix, retry, skip, or pause.
7. On `stop`/`pause`: agent writes `status: paused` and halts.

**Prepare bundle files — for every bundle with `perform: true`:**
1. Inspect bundle code and current descriptor usage.
2. Update `README.md` — runtime behavior, config props, secrets, operational notes.
3. Update `config/bundles.template.yaml` — non-secret descriptor shape.
4. Update `config/bundles.secrets.template.yaml` — bundle-scoped secrets shape; if none: `secrets: {}`.
5. Update `release.yaml` — set `bundle.ref` to the release version, add human-readable bullets.

**Validate before commit:**
- `git status` — confirm no unrelated or generated files are staged
- Validate YAML files if a parser is available
- `python3 -m py_compile` on changed Python files

**Agent rules:**
- Use the human-provided version string exactly — never infer it from the date.
- Read existing `release.yaml` before writing; do not overwrite release notes blindly.
- Stage only the release files for in-scope bundles; never stage unrelated or generated files.
- If `commit: false` / `tag: false` / `push: false`, skip that step entirely.
- If a git tag already exists at the requested version, stop and ask what to do.
- Never put real secrets into `bundles.template.yaml` or `bundles.secrets.template.yaml` config examples.
- Keep customer-specific repository details inside customer repositories; keep this procedure generic.

### Tier 2 — read only on demand (when Tier 1 is not enough)

**Header-first gate:** Before reading any Tier 2 doc in full, fetch it and read only the
title and first section (≈first 30 lines, up to the first `##` heading). Then ask yourself:
does this doc specifically address what I am implementing right now? If yes — read the rest.
If no — stop; you have confirmed it is not needed for this task.

Pull these when the task specifically hits the topic. Do not preload. All under

### Local fast path (opt-in — do not ask for it)

If — **and only if** — `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_KDCUBE_REPO_ROOT` is already set in the
environment, read the same paths from
`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_KDCUBE_REPO_ROOT/<repo-relative-path>` with `Read`. Derive the
repo-relative path by stripping the `repo:kdcube-ai-app/` prefix from any reference above.
If the env var is not set, do not suggest setting it — just resolve the `repo:` reference.

## Primary example

Default to `versatile` (Tier 1). Pull specialized examples from Tier 2 only when the task
is specifically about `ks:` / custom namespace resolvers, isolated exec, or the Node/TS bridge.

**Versatile is NOT a reference for `@cron` or `@venv`** — it does not use them. If the task
needs either decorator, read `bundle-scheduled-jobs-README.md` (for `@cron`) or
`bundle-venv-README.md` (for `@venv`) from Tier 2 before writing code. The copyable
snippets in `how-to-write-bundle-README.md` §4.1 are the minimum correct starting point.

## Register the bundle in `bundles.yaml`

Recommended form — `path` = bundle root, `module: entrypoint`:

```yaml
bundles:
  items:
    - id: "<bundle-id>"
      name: "<Human Name>"
      path: "/bundles/<relative-path-from-host_bundles_path>"
      module: "entrypoint"
```

`path` is the **container path** — `/bundles/` + the bundle's path relative to
`assembly.yaml -> paths.host_bundles_path`. It is **not** `/bundles/<bundle-id>` unless
the bundle directory happens to sit directly under `host_bundles_path` with that name.
Host path in `bundles.yaml` is the #1 source of silent reload failures — see
"Host path and runtime path are not the same thing" in the how-to.

Alternative form (less readable, use only when needed): `path` points at the parent,
`module` carries the bundle subdir — `module: "<bundle_dir>.entrypoint"`.

## Workflows

### Write a bundle from scratch

1. Resolve `$WORKDIR` (ask the user if not found).
2. Read Tier 1 (3 how-to docs + versatile reference bundle end-to-end).
3. If the task hits a specialized feature (`@cron`, `@venv`, KS, Node bridge, isolated
   exec, specific descriptor edit), pull the matching Tier 2 doc.
3a. **Run the SDK-discovery gate (Rule #6) for every subsystem in the bundle plan.**
    List each subsystem (persistence, scheduling, transport, identity, UI serving,
    agent loop, model dispatch, …), search the SDK for it, and record the verdict in
    `docs/design/<topic>.md` *before* writing any code. Treat this as part of the
    Tier 1 read, not as optional.
4. Pick a host directory for the bundle (default `~/.kdcube/bundles/<bundle-id>/`,
   or wherever the user asked). Create it and write `entrypoint.py` + `__init__.py`.
5. Register the bundle via CLI — **do not edit `$WORKDIR` files directly**:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/kdcube_local.py" bootstrap <bundle-id> <bundle-path>
   ```
   If the bundle lives outside the current `host_bundles_path`, pass `--host-bundles-path
   <parent>` so the mount root is updated atomically.
6. Run bundle tests (`bundle-tests <host-path>`), then reload + verify-reload.

### Wrap an existing application into a bundle

1. Resolve `$WORKDIR` (ask if not found).
2. Read the existing app's code to understand entry points, APIs, and data.
3. Read Tier 1 (3 how-to docs + versatile). Pull Tier 2 on demand.
3a. **Run the SDK-discovery gate (Rule #6) for every subsystem the existing app
    implements.** Treat the existing app's storage / queue / scheduler / transport
    classes as *candidates for removal*, not as code to preserve — for each one,
    search the SDK and either replace it with the SDK block or write the
    justification in `docs/design/<topic>.md`.
4. Map the app's functionality to bundle primitives (`@api`, `@ui_main`, `@cron`, etc.).
5. Pick a host directory (default `~/.kdcube/bundles/<bundle-id>/`, or wherever the user
   asked). Copy the app source into it (or under a subdir) and call it from `entrypoint.py`.
   Do not modify the original app tree.
6. Register via `kdcube_local.py bootstrap` (see step 5 above), run bundle tests,
   then reload + verify-reload.

### Add a feature to an existing bundle

1. Read the existing `entrypoint.py` and the relevant docs section.
1a. **Run the SDK-discovery gate (Rule #6) for the new feature.** A "small" feature
    is the most common place agents hand-roll something the SDK already provides,
    because the read-Tier-1 step gets skipped on incremental work. Record the
    verdict in the journal entry for this session before writing code.
2. Make the minimal change that adds the feature.
3. Run bundle tests, then reload + verify-reload.

## Authoring rules

- Read the docs and examples before writing code — every time, even for small changes.
- Do not invent decorators, import paths, or bundle tree layout.
- For third-party Python packages, first check whether the runtime already has them.
- Use `@venv(...)` for dependency-heavy leaf helpers, not for request-bound orchestration.
- Keep communicator, request context, Redis, DB clients, and other live proc/runtime
  bindings outside `@venv(...)`.
- If a Node backend is needed, keep Python as the bundle boundary and put Node/TS behind a
  narrow bridge.
- If local runtime setup is needed, use `/kdcube-builder:bootstrap-local` first.
- **`.kdcube-runtime` is read-only** — see Rule #0 at the top of this skill. This is the
  absolute constraint; refer to Rule #0 if in doubt. Bundle source files outside `$WORKDIR`
  are editable as normal.

## Validation + reload

Run the shared bundle suite before considering bundle work done:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/kdcube_local.py" bundle-tests /abs/path/to/bundle
```

Then reload if the runtime is running — **always pair `reload` with `verify-reload`**:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/kdcube_local.py" reload <bundle-id>
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/kdcube_local.py" verify-reload <bundle-id>
```

### Reload rules (read before touching a running runtime)

- Editing files in `HOST_BUNDLES_PATH/<bundle-id>/` does **not** hot-reload. The runtime
  serves the cached bundle until an explicit `reload <bundle-id>`. Old code keeps running
  until you reload — that is the usual cause of "my change didn't take effect".
- `reload` only works if `<bundle-id>` is registered in `bundles.yaml` with the correct
  container path (`/bundles/<bundle-id>`). A typo or host-path in `bundles.yaml` makes the
  reload succeed-looking but no-op.
- **Always run `verify-reload` after `reload`.** The reload call returns before the proc
  cache actually rotates; without verify you do not know whether the new code is live.
- `verify-reload` reporting `eviction: None` for a bundle that was supposed to be active is
  a red flag — the bundle was never in the proc cache, which usually means the id/path in
  `bundles.yaml` is wrong, or the bundle was never loaded in the first place.
- Any container restart (secrets injection, `kdcube --stop`/`start`, Docker restart) drops
  the proc cache. Reload every active bundle immediately after such events.
